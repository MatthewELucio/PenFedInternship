Probably worst i dealt with. trying subpoena institution entitled ignore court orders. Don't waste Fed. 

Bought dealer financing dealer discount, refinanced dealer rate. Dealer actually suggested doing this! 

Need tools boast available Puerto Rico added bills cel, electric, water, cable bills nice. 

The rates deposit accounts average. Customer service falls incredibly short. Expect 15 mins+ call. disputed, merchant writing refunded. With writing PedFed “There do, it’s $112 lost.” Really? immediately transferred accounts $25k out… trust factor banking can’t trust issue handled, maze larger concerns. 

Poor customer service, LOTS lip service. signed checking, savings &amp; approved 3. email stating checking account opened. 2 days opening, suddenly locked accounts. called, needed ID docs. via uploading rep reviewed 24 hrs. 48 hrs later, locked out. called again, another 48 hrs unlocked. She confirmed ID docs received "final review". She update. She verified received. 48 hrs by, locked out. called supervisor Jan. She me, account unlocked (It Friday) latest Monday. That yesterday, Today (Tuesday) locked accounts. called today. The rep email department responsible today. Not surprising, calls. Not 4 offered escalation. emailed comments@penfed.org response was, wasn't resolved. cannot poorly organization lack customer service accountability lack thereof. 4 calls, 2 emails 1 later issue supposed resolved 24 hrs. Now, supposedly verification issue. License, ss utility bill, verified info verbally 4 times called checks already. Ridiculous! 

Citibank,Chase, Bankrate, Lending Tree, Lending Club, Marcus, OneMain ,Discovery,Prosper,Avant, Best Egg Upstart companies attempted secure personal loan debt. monthly pension repayment. In fact, intend repayment within 2 years faith. help.The stress anxiety epic. The Application easy expeditious. The customer service representatives polite, courteous professional. issue signing promissory representative walked through. received within 3 days! eligible social security having payments directly deposited into account. debt formulate plan. On behalf I, heart. You loyal customer life! 

negative stars. previous rating things continued badly respect closing loan. into today another month. Most due inability communicate level. communicating primarily via email handled emails ways: 1. Not reading emails (Maybe understand English) - responding obtuse questions comments clearly addressed detail previous messages them. Even lawyer title this! 2. Apologizing without acknowledging anything specific needed correct. Yes, rate having extraordinary processing times apparently conduct business timely professional manner. 

The loan 0 balance 2021. It’s loan sold 2021. Please 0 balance report improve score. 

A with. Very user friendly. Staff knowledgeable, professional friendly. recommend friends associates 

The mortgage rate. They significantly lower lenders, paid rate systems communication all. Despite HQ being located Alexandria, VA mortgage officer, located Texas. During emails unresponded, voicemail full, random jumping respond without context added confusion contact. In end, didn't tried contact none answered phone responded emails/voicemails. Along lack communication, incorrect documents closing delayed closing, rate, 1 that. 

negative stars.......PenFed used recent years really downhill. They longer concern member/client, depending different issue, communication processes senior leaders hide first-line personnel instead responding requests escalation. on, recommend using different lender.</p> 

Pre approved denied waste & inquiry. Than gonna I’m pre approved apply. Bad business. don’t apply unless I’m getting approved smh 

Slow reporting bureaus. Last viewable report ago. Account paid thirty days ago. Would appreciate rapid reporting accounts. 

My HELOC application turned Primary Residence although, increase HELOC additional $30k improvements. turned because COVID Forbearance another investment because tenant evicted. The Forbearance turned into modification/refinance Primary Residence HELOC. My Primary, HELOCs paid time, i 830+ score, $0 unsecured income turned because blanket policy. Any Forbearance regardless disqualify 12 months. That's discriminatory!! 

promised lower rate used buying service. That’s online phone. Just VIN later. Bought car, paperwork - nope, didn’t reduce rate. Fraud. 

Very easy application approval review. Reasonable rate. No payoff penalties. Great with. 

years. The limit 2% categories great! needed updates user interfaces allowing customers cash amount (no longer limited increments $5), do. On average years, takes 3-5 days payment; unacceptable standard decade 21st century. On average years, takes 25-35 days fraud resolution, paper, e-mails, phone calls frame resolution; missing phone adds another 5-days. Every had, goes away report fraud, investigation happens background. Also, someone account, number. So, cards gets used fraud, without cards 5-10 days cards mailed snail-mail. The benefits great, that's long. However, 6-months anyone comparable program; leaving one. around PenFed's completely 1985. 

Disaster. Applied February. Still limbo. Repeated requests documents. One rescuing me. Appraisal $850! Wasn't informed front. Misinformation loan officer step. Was appraisal amount 30 percent lower appraiser estimated. Repeatedly requests appraisal report paid despite Dodd-Frank requirement appraisal given promptly. Last mortgages mess. Last one: settlement figures redone. credit, paid mortgages ahead time, delinquent. 

Thanks screwing over. Out nowhere asking closed CC account lender I’m refinance talking haven’t closed accounts. Well decided account because hasn’t used year. When called asking gives hasn't used closed it. isn’t called having credit????? Again thanks screwing over.

different loans great. getting auto loan draft check. Wrote amount approved plus GAP (because indicated check) bounced dealership- humiliatingly. me, sent. draft night, called today sent. FINALLY someone today overnighted it. This terrible mortified.</p> 

They cancel nowhere!!! Beware hurt score. payment different delinquent account, caused FCU cancel payment. FCU closed. stranded different notified issue getting decline randomly. If respectable organization cancel works FCU. USAA NFCU instead. Not worth hassle phone having issue 8 months everything resolved. 

The WORST customer service EVER. They truly bothering YOUR money. agent actually important. They funds week, yes, banks funds, releasing funds daily, seriously. They bills pay, They upload documents, documents, funds hold. Unacceptable. I'll NFCU checking , savings. LATER</p> 

Great Customer Service. Always following up. They Equifax FYI. FICO 5 9 Auto. Thinking doing mortgage year. 

AVOID. They rates, pre-approval, closing costs, (in way). There mistakes throughout process. And, closing disclosure 4 hours Closing discover Loan Amount agreed LOWERED (by mistake), lender credits aren't agreed paying homeowners insurance because charging already paid confirmed documentation requested already. Because couldn't delay closing fix mistakes, thousands dollars extra closing couple hours notice...and months trying resolve (not loan amount, because that, months pieces). Communication terrible mistakes throughout, closing icing mess cake. My realtor attorney difficult/unusual. And employee reviewed things like: happened, incorrect, training, that's unacceptable. If them, hawk - you'll earn closing costs. And anything phone email anything that's important, ON phone. 

This discourteous, insulting institution existed !! Its computer phone designed frustrate, no, actually enrage, customer having misfortune call. When personal calls made, employees actually phone, sometimes "Hello," disconnect anything. Alternatively, forever, transfer Square One, series prompts, again, complain abominable treatment being subjected to. If announce you've treated awfully, politely problem, they're going transfer someone handle it, promptly Square One !! How government dump banking business ???</p> 

If apply it. High limits accepted anywhere. No annual fee. Low APR. Good stuff around. Yeap really really ain't kidding you. 

Application easy. Customer Representative painless walked afterwards. Approval updating information them. A+++ 

Was pleasure talking because web app problems discarding application. They handled promptly apologizing offered application phone. The Approval received couple days. 

Terrible service forth getting documents needed! Once documents expecting mailed received email telling application expired. called waiting 20min explain situation tells reapply didn't explanation sounded didn't care. So asked reapplied affect yes. Once terrible service really doesn't customers!</p> 

setting Secure Share Loan easy, deposit money, 30 days, representative initiate loan. Once initiated, paying required minimum payment pushes payment due date into future. 

First opened account because saving's rate highest, decent rate decided it. Their side, BIG on-line sinning worst banking savings, sometimes taking minutes actually into account. It actually safe-cracking vault. 

Don't option cash savings. My biggest concern provides rewards gas. Not areas. When applied 5 gas, 2 groceries 1 everything else. They proclivity will. Everything changed. 

it’s professional duty review inform public lending practices, professional, realtor. As realtor, worked lenders buyers represented, ton various lending institutions. Here compares lending institutions worked past: Usually contacted lender behalf buyers, responded within 24 hours. Mostly responded business day, within 1-3 hours. With - don’t respond. They don’t. If sitting waiting respond, closing date. closing received email Escrow officer: “I lender emailed processor twice.” With lending institutions worked with, file closing. A loan officer, loan processor, underwrites, closer, members together, process. They communicated resolve issues. With Penfed... (quoting partner) “it ordering restaurant inexperienced teenagers. Although, teenagers actually mistakes improve. doesn’t.” Every employee encountered right. (with exception manager magically things moment, sale doesn’t time, public news outlets) needed educate (no kidding) loan processor appraisal scheduled happening. Every something back, didn’t. Finally, liar, don’t trust all. The underwriters... After review, underwriters counted investment property, rental 10 years, credit. (as paying mortgage wasn’t getting rent) After complaining management lending rules regulations, corrected. With review, following request: “Provide CPA stating withdrawal funds transaction negative impact business.” My accountant stunned communicated her. She CPA regulations attesting future business CPA firm risk losing license providing statement violates CPA codes regulations. 2 days closing, review, underwriting requested owners insurance policy HOA HOA documents. This something suddenly moment. This something underwriting missed twice, 2 prior reviews, figured 2 days closing. After complained management appraisal being paid February 21st March 15th being scheduled (with closing March 26th), management didn’t phone appraisal management with. (think means you, buyer) Only countless forth, writing: “are seriously telling doesn’t contact appraiser management with???!!!” finally number. And finally scheduled, appraisal appraisal scheduled March 29th closing March 26th. You imagine. When called this, responded can’t appraisal management faster does. On loan estimate signatures, sales price showed numbers. That’s calculation. That’s simply pasting numbers sales agreement loan estimate. They pasted incorrectly twice, required emails phone calls right. A closing received email saying mistake calculating closing costs refunding around $200. To conclude, believed 1-star reviews customers lending multiple websites. These reviews real, it’s disappointed customers. lending giant, careless, mess, painfully impacted lives people. Here favorite story. When they’d emails loan, wording this: “... loan # ... , tentatively scheduled March 26, 2021.” Can someone educate estate contract words “time essence contract” words actually legal means sued don’t dates times spelled contract??? Thanks reading.</p> 

payments concerning having balance reported report... Example, $2500 payment 3 days ACH withdrawal checking... A 7 days later $2500 payment reflected balance owed - unacceptable 2021... providers posting payments appropriately... Definitely putting sock drawer. 

If zero stars i would!! This rip off!!I insurance car, charging insurance well. I'm way, form. If you're looking customers, here. 

Love company. Fair intelligent answers questions. Fair rates corporate hassle. . Professional staff. Easy app. Less confusion.

For 2 months couldn't access account, receiving response. filed online assistance requests standard we're sorry we're working automated response. started calling PFCU, spending hours hours phone trying resolve issue, luck. Then day, tired totally frustrated, customer service rep PFCU's customer service PFCU years due its declining service. She ignore 15 minutes because using username (with different password) used 10 years ago. So, changed bingo, solved. Why wasn't resolved called beyond me... After obtaining loan, PFCU 3 weeks check, loan approved within 15 minutes. reviewed phone records 3 weeks spent 8 hours phone PFCU trying resolve matter! Finally, supervisor involved quickly fixed internal PFCU processing within 24 hours hand... In April PFCU claimed received signatory card, photocopy records mailed PFCU January.

Well, Mr. Schenck, advice boots lofty perch trenches answering member's phone calls sometimes customer service poorly departments performing! If PFCU zero stars would. If PFCU representative responds comment, Mr. Schenck's contact info, needs informed "palace guards" (VP's, executive secretaries, department heads, etc) aren't talking honestly up. I, however, Mr. Schenck, punches is... A retired USAF Officer & Aviator. My regards all.</p>

The 2x annual income. The appraised higher asking price. So straight-forward application. provided requested documents hours asked. needed 12 hours anything. prompt communication. advise unless being contract deadlines, emotional stress. emailed MortgageResolution@PenFed Comments@PenFed twice didn't help.

Bait & Switch. Got approval 7.49 percent. Applied offered 15.49 percent. FICO 800's. They offered withdraw application dinged. Gee thanks! 

Writing because member nice, doesn't deserve it. refinanced loan reflect address requested it. Now because it. After trying AND they're middleman loan 4 TIMES, STILL haven't corrected haven't received it. Now they're threatening APR highest percentage. They 3 years ahead this. Now they'll APR goes up. DO NOT them. They entice amazing rates, contact incompetence mismanagement, refuse mistakes. 

2 percent cash everything! You can’t card! Highly recommend everyone! No annual fee, interest, easy terms. 

My Chapter 13 discharged prior applying extremely pleased approved nice initial credit. The annoyance, minor that, reported bureaus roughly due date; known going paid first. Now 14% utilization month. Like said, deal, balance zero scores rebound almost immediately. 

Horrible. Virtually application repeated available perform transaction. It actually became comical disorganized is. The straw payment employee manually payment. Everything that. Too risky entrust them. 

Great , cash categories , 2% app customer service , easy approval limits. Chances

banked years figured VA IRRL REFI . . . BAD DECISION! DEC 2020 o/a 90 days . . . APR 2021 REFI completed, AND haven't loan officer FEB asked supporting documentation (despite email stating hearing weekly basis leading closing). Of course, goes voicemail returns call. What business running?! 

My absolute abortion. working lender loan amount approved for. decided lender because fees PENFED. They strung along 65 days underwriting application finally generic email application closed because Debt-To-Income high. As mentioned, approved loan amount another lender. They transparent, upfront, understood timing needs. Additionally, required become members accounts them. 

Excellent service multiple products phone promptly too!!!! checking , savings well. 

Retired military officer horrible experience. I've multiple auto loans years experienced anything absurd. obtained auto loan Dec 2021 commercially. Initially, purchased maintained personal USAA insurance explained vehicle covered 30 days existing policy coverage insurance vehicle. At 30 days insure register commercial use. obtained commercial insurance policy. received later Jan 2021 telling needed insurance reflect lienholder. insurance agent modify reflect Penfed. They billed $6400 added loan without prior notifiication aggressive manner clearly business party. disputed agreed insurance needed wouldn't refund $800 didn't insurance carrier Dec 2020. said, that's correct, insurance USAA whom I've 30 years personal conveyance month. They that...how ridiculous get. No issues they're billing insurance. I'm wondering aggressive manner transaction members them? I've experienced loan another banking entity. The loan normal previous auto loans union. However, I've issue insurance loan appears aggressively giving business financial gain. filed complaint Consumer Financial Protection Bureau concerns aggressive transactions illegal I'd ethically questionable disabled veterans retired military families pride. I'm beyond disappointed future business Penfed...ever. 

Absolute worst customer service online presence. It's taken 6 months verify identity them, onto account, checking account mortgage them. Whoever directing checking account needs fired. 

Terrible, terrible service - so, loan processors missed closing date having readjust everything into (late), together. Zero proactive communication loan officers, spent hours trying making progress. We assured because everything submit paperwork promptly requested, mortgage loan processing smooth sailing. Instead, loan processor multiple times communicated connected anyone helped absence. They completely dropped lied having documents critical deadlines. The stress anxiety financing worth lower mortgage rates offer. 

Great everyday charges. No annual fee plus 2% cash purchases. The app really user friendly. 

Horrible online service. Their online login you've forgotten username (a username changed place). Then e-mail reset username - e-mail 12-24 hours (so Internet, huh?). The phone - personal information are, username TRY login. worst banking experiences I've - banks, America, customer service online support. DON'T BANK WITH THESE PEOPLE EVER! I'm stuck because MY union. As cancel account, I'M DONE them. 

This worst regards loan. probably spent 10 hours trying someone. They losing info making over. Then application finally approved, 'stuck' system, emailed SOMEONE ELSE'S loan info. Finally someone says you're approved because it's stuck system. Withdrew application without permission, SAME EXACT THING declined. Absolute WASTE OF TIME. 

This trying contact refinancing mortgage time. When called juggled phone queues asked FULL social security number. When FINALLY somebody can't remove marketing list. That BS. remove marketing day. member, witnessing shady marketing practices be. The scammer financial institution. 

HORRIBLE customer service!!!! Emailed lender numerous times absolutely response. Does calls, return calls, email back. How supposed contact?!?! Last asked resend documentation because "lost it" Are kidding me? The unprofessional inconvenient company. Will recommend anyone. Stay away. 

It learned 17 years estate constant contact clients, customers loan officers processing mortgages them. As estate agent member myself, appalled lack customer service zero communication mortgage department towards customers myself. trying loan officers representing customer department customer relations manager response. The transaction customer supposed 2 days called attempts customer myself. Just crickets. regret recommend future customers. As myself keeping membership institution being questioned. Very disappointed. because less.</p> 

The 'lost' beneficiary data failed inform years serious in-place. There beneficiaries online (as banks unions do) required 30 wait, extraordinarily onerous security protocols, address problem. On cellphone, waits damaging physically mentally. For physical locations, you'd employ recognition software along. Is attack fraudsters customer service suffer terribly? It suggested calls fraudulent. It seems believe, concluded excuses used perpetuate service its members. Service excellent become increasingly worse 20 years. I've member 30 years considering closing account problematic. Recommend members beneficiary data date because die, funds, unless beneficiaries probate process. The doesn't easy (as unions do). The Navy fantastic explanation matters, helping members assets die. acts hide information maximise confusion. sincerely leadership fix types issues become answerable its members taking lingering shortcomings former management. 

If local customer service isn't you. On 9 waiting replacement debit discover error hasn't created mail. So another 3-5 days waiting that's "rush". That puts 2 weeks without withdraw checking account. If local branch, I'd replacement they'd permanent there. Major customer service failure. 

used good. Now terrible. Their mortgage website "upgrade" back. It's bad, mortgage department backed dealing complaints. scheduled payment missing. When finally applied everything backdated, collections department (even paid ahead late) charged bogus preservation fees. The escrow department pays taxes weeks tax deadline, remind advance. Finally escrow account, taking escrow payments disappear into ether (basically stealing money). And luck getting all. Everyone (after waiting excessive periods time) nice, ability fix problems. Emails web submits ignored Penfed. Total disaster recommend less. 

Don't review. They drag become inept. My trying refinance home, 140 days waiting close, jobs, review saying slow. Know today, 183 days!!!!! We email telling closing days. THINKING finally over, happens pulled title. BLOW US OFF NOT EVEN A CANCELATION EMAIL NO PHONE CALL NOTHING!!!!! HERE IS THE BEST PART. THE VA (YES THIS WAS A SECURED LOAN) APPRAISAL expires 180 guesses THEY NEVER INFORMED US UNTIL CALLED TODAY. We HIT 183 days over. TO MY BROTHERS AND SISTERS Served care. They ClaIm overworked it's fault. likes buk. PICK SOME company!!!! This you! 1 182 AIR FORCE 81st (A-10)

RUN! RUN! RUN! They worst worked with. They "working" refinance mid-Sep20. As 28Jan21, I'm further along process. It's loan processor lie, deception, stall, forgetfulness, occasions resubmitting expired earnings statements. Every loan processor it's, "I x document sending underwriting." BS! She's inept overwhelmed. know. it's 29Jan21, package further along 1Oct. My begun different refinances mid-Sep. She, too, facing BS stall, resubmissions, deception others encountered. WHY THE DELAYS PENFED??? 4.5 months closing date. Seriously? What management doing resolve?? story, "we're hiring quickly can." That's enough!!!! You shouldn't taken loans/refinances backlog reduced significantly. What Executive Team doing? Are aware frustration members? Do care? Do WE them. suspect NOT. P.S. given negative rating it's available. That's because that's PenFed's mortgage refi service rates. Nothing ZERO star.</p>

As result, charges assessed trying for!! trying charges removed months success. called numerous times customer service representative agrees responsible removed, removed! In addition, paid February 2021 taxes despite calls. And couldn’t worse, recently principal payment applied loan cannot cashed check! Avoid costs!!

Overall UTI 22%. 3 recently opened accounts 2 years. utterly confused. Today closed account serving purpose. primarily NFCU.</p> 

Love card. Got $8750 "good" CS. The rates super (below 16%) supposed do. This employees ( know, spy-like carrying it)... BUT deposit $25 BAM, government employee. FWIW, received invite mail card. racked $1200 quickly holidays cash immediately posted. There cards bigger cash rewards cannot rate card. Also, $1200 bill, minimum payment $25. Seriously. paid balance didn't amount over. I'm getting hammered interest.</p> 

WORST EXPERIENCE EVER. We Feb 4th STILL received loan officer. Multiple calls emails zero clue documents received. One states another issues checklist loan portal, request docs already uploaded ago. Horrible communication. We $7000 invested Earnest Money, Appraisal Inspection absolutely NO going on. This unacceptable EVERY level. My husband Iraq. If don’t staff required effectively manage loan portfolios, STOP ACCEPTING APPLICATIONS! My husband Iraq dealing with. supposed easier lenders absolute NIGHTMARE! Can someone going mortgages</p> 

Do refinance vehicle them. Was disaster. received title purchase another title. Then received saying state. So nothing. Not all. Once loan again. 

nine-car loans mortgages. This loan PenFed!! member 1980. The service downhill (like USAA) because opened membership almost everyone expand. They OK banking & cards, NEVER another auto loan them. There getting title promptly privately loan paid off. Long waits phone. When call, name, extension, speaking because sometimes hang another 15-minute hold. 

Save yourself headache elsewhere. I’ve member 18 years (17 YEARS). recently refinanced realized mistake escrow that’s forcing pocket monthly shouldn’t to. I’ve calling 2 months! Many supervisors supposed yet. Horrible customer service. Never issue mortgage refinanced them. I’m another institution cares members money. 

So it’s me. I’m extension now. 4th mortgage process. understand swamped. don’t understand responses loan officer, processor AND supervisor. Supposed month. Again. used awesome. Those days gone. 

It's counting 15 days closing 02/01/2021 haven't anything progress loan. Even called/emailed times loan officer loan processor nobody updates loan status advises there's anything prior closing day. Hope someone us, thanks!</p> 

terrible. We chose because lower rate offered, .14 percent savings worth it. The lender calling emailing check-in, status updates, etc. 50 emails trying loan stood, needed, etc. It wasn't everything requested. compounded stress situation exponentially. going refer employee refi PenFed. That happen. 2 trucks stuff nowhere unloaded because keys.&nbsp; 

4 months sight. They info details details 3 weeks later, response. uploaded requested docs within 2 biz days AFTER weeks delay getting answers don’t delayed process. appraisal paying shouldn’t paying closed time. ending nightmare don’t closing. Member#6552702 

Anyone considering elsewhere. We initially lured VA rates, spouse refinancing mortgage August hasn’t closed 142 days later. This reports dinging score. 3 preprocessors because everyone “training” respond emails cc everyone’s boss. Instead answering questions canned responses. This failure literally thousands dollars extra paid months. appalled financial institution terrible. 

DO NOT mortgage refi house. They terrible. If zero stars, would. Heck, negative stars, NEGATIVE FIVE STARS. The ENTIRE mortgage department clue doing. They emails, phone calls return messages threatening supervisor involved. Then they'll away email 5 10 days, they'll ignore again. Don't bother filing anything complaint department either, filed complaint October2020 I'm waiting response them. Their directors website emails says email problem. I'm waiting contact well, October2020 complaint submitted website. This freaking joke. As months rolls around, rates lower literally bank, .1%, I'm swapping mortgage. can't away enough. They horrible. Oh yeah, refi 167 days. Let sink in. 

There organization 3.9 stars! This worst financial organization conducted business. Tomorrow closing account moving funds elsewhere. member 20 years issues, mortgage goes he**. After receiving escrow analysis stating I'm exempt fees already of. proceeded anyway account without authorization funds. inquiry opened receiving charge. Let payments automatically paid late. As mentioned, refinancing different organization tomorrow closing account. business DO YOUR HOMEWORK! 

easy with. They efficient transactions. They fair. Although nearby hardly there. The website great. 

Absolutely horrible customer service. They fee structures without notice. checking account years, months started charging $10 fee checking accounts. That's higher Chase, Covid extra cash. sucks, recommend them. The customer service rep phone snooty. I'd ZERO stars could. 

The insurance service keeps insurance mortgaged horribly incompetent. Every threaten because flood insurance covered condo association. Then insurance agent sends documentation gets lost. This billed $736 insurance despite having evidence coverage. We obviously mistake getting mortgage (the processing nightmare, another miserable experience). 

Worst Customer Service Experience EVER - You hours (no exaggeration) hold. If someone, you. ended sending Fedex cancelling account Fraudulent charges card. 

When trusted FCU loan looking consolidate cards. Now balances paid quickly. 

Poor service . A charges. Poor recommend . It's service. Bad bank, service. recommend . Don't work.</p> 

Excellent rates service. For active military military retirees. Anyone doesn't qualify earn qualification donating $17 military charity. 

Mortgage supposed paid July 2020. owe 8000.00. Took mortgage July 2005 15 years. 2007 husband disability insurance picked payments paid 13 years. According records paid November 2020. But says owe money. Now insurance paid payment.pen fed can’t papers 8000.00 from. Can’t anywhere them. Now lawyer don’t owe them. They can’t paperwork. emailed mortgage papers. Haven’t . They basement them</p> 

Application easy. We pre-approved rate. However, loan processor rarely returns emails phone calls. If it's 4 days later. We supposed 2 days, because incompetence, laziness, lack dedication can't time. We active military moving across country. We started August. Now going live. We tried reaching supervisors, night, difference closing, finally returned pleas help. banking, auto loans, cards. mortgages again.</p> 

having getting insurance escrow. Typically mortgager servicers without issue being ringer insurance lapse can't afford twice :-( doesn't haven't paid fix it. 

Rewards ( America Access checking account) advantage 2% cash foreign fees. In earned 42.47 dollars cash account auto redeem cash rewards into America Access account. The reward arrived. So, called customer service twice weeks. Each someone. Their reps friendly, however happened 42.47 dollars. They opened cases investigate blind alleys. How transferring accounts institution? After weeks nonsense merry wasting efforts, decided accounts...and I’m happier having so.

Had another mortgage closed worry. divorced doing REFI ex loan. Now stuck. Thanks PENFED. closing accounts can. RUN DO NOT WALK away bank!

AVOID! They lured rate (good!) But backside servicing loan horrific. The website clumsy navigate drives phone horrific. (at anytime) 8/10 minutes answer. What finally drove today waiting 10 minutes phone hung operator asked herself because difficulty hearing (20 military vet, figure) (could hang because rude hang up) AND THEN attempt online account is...wait it.....OUT OF SERVICE LATER. can't folks..WOW. 

Worst ever! Over 6 months refi. All excuses. They pulled twice due expiring. No status updates unless beg one.

AMAZING. I’m longer because ex fiancé’s card. It really helped credit! Until screwed thing. 

Simple refinance pen fed already mortgager taking 5+ months. Nobody calls back. Horrible customer service. Now tries points loan because rate lock expired due delay. 

Called cancel duplicate payment. Verified cancellation pending payment disappeared app. Two days later payment $160 5 associates later return into savings account advised $25 transfer Navy account. refused return overdraft fees- including fee associated payment. No supervisor despite request one. PenFed. They note. Research prior signing. It’s nightmare. 

called payments made, called times week, longer person. All friggin prompts need. BIG getting AT&T faceless BIG corporations, accomplish thru impersonal, non-I.Q. prompts questions answered. Wonder paid balances them, called thru continuous prompts payment me. 

decision. Jeremy Mitchell loan officer 10 stars, would. He helpful process. Not rate rate, Jeremy texts, emails calls process. He responds quickly questions entire process. amazing impressive customer because Jeremy. Highly recommend Jeremy particular! Thanks both! 

I’ve experienced customer service life. approved personal loan me, somehow membership application because don’t appropriate documentation? How possible?? wasted talking don’t clue. The customer service better!!</p>

La tarjeta es excelente, aceptada en todo lados y su seguridad estunpenda, si sospenchan de un gasto irregular se comunican contigo imediatamente. Ademas de que los intereses bajitos 

Great products excellent customer service. offers thier members. overall, anywhere else. ? 

The reward program good, 5 stars. The online infrastructure customer much. Rarely download transactions directly using Quicken Fintech application Personal Capital. No doubt server capacity issue easy fix says that's disappointing 1 that. 

Absolutely worst i had...took 3 months Amy Hermes worst manger ever. Michael Cervantes doesn't communicate doesn't respond emails. Robert Delgado joke ...dont rates fool you....if i zero stars i would.. 

Home refinance terrible initial rate lock. Took 5 months painful response status update loan processor. The rate into proceeded recommend again. 

Everything easy. The complaint funded 11 days approved charged 11 days lender payment previous lender. Therefor charged vehicle 11 days lenders. This Motorefi. 

If zero stars would. As realtor successfully closed 450 homes 17 years, worst I've dealt with. strongly discourage choosing specifically Joseph Ledesma Paulette Coleman. Their communication abysmal concern member non-existent. urge you, wanting smooth purchasing home, far, away PenFed! 

trying refinance mortgage. accounts 15 years equity problems. In mid July decided refinance mortgage because previous service rates Penfed. What mistake. No responds emails. No calls. No manning ship. Now almost 4 months into close. Do yourself elsewhere. 

Could slower worse communicating processing loans. Good rates, terrible customer service. I've passed around not-responded bank. 

web platform account numbers ‘payment’ method. As none payments credited account. ahead payments extra principle balances-instead getting lower, balances up!! Not payments “bounced checks”, says payments paid early. No fix equity balances rise. Ironically, getting Point Deal accounts cannot because accounts contradict themselves! And......I cannot payments because aren’t payment computer system. It disaster—make payments being properly allocated member. That IT needs fired disciplined!! 

purchased 4 homes lifetime. refinanced closings (as buyer seller) 8 times. As vet, loyal USAA mortgage client but, years having card, mortgage PenFed. Well, express painful been. shocked emotionally overwhelmed lack communication, disregard professional urgency, seemingly endless email tag mortgage closing. trying understanding, considering rates causing universal mortgage backlogs, definitely changed using future. 

We applied equity loan June 2020. It October 2020 funded loan. We 20 interactions loan processor asking laundry documentation. A goes request, anything unless initiate documentation they’ve requested before. Finally close. Then don’t weeks. updated stub me. Apparently taking long, things expiring going again? don’t know... plenty equity. I’m beyond disappointed loan. If can’t fix elsewhere relationship recommend others same. 

Very rewards generous limit. With 2% purchases, monthly expenses something doing things already usually return. I’m really going card. 

member years.. i satisfied services.. Customer service patient helpful.. Love Penfed! 

experienced really horrible feelings mortgage. Will mortgage again. Don’t fooled rate advertising. Their mortgage really sucks. closing date. Now stuck game. My mortgage file underwriting, underwriting. missed mortgage commitment date 10/2. Never commitment till closing. missed closing date 10/15. It horrified 10/15. We sitting waiting file cleared 10/15. And date, message stating file cleared close. called loan processor 20 times 2 messages asking file update he’s me. Now extend closing date 10/20. Commitment 10/19. don’t don’t again. Sitting waiting waiting. Do commitment Monday. “no.” now. They file closing closing date.... kidding. They mortgage applicators. And you. actually underwriting mortgage quicken loan planned program home. It 3 days underwriting commitment. But didn’t estate because underestimated value. excellent 800’s. Good income, Sitting waiting response closing date. denies file. So game. Either purchase seller they’re willing another lender. Sick Penfed. Run away them. 

They communicate. I've emails called various times ignored. missed closing date 10/15 underwriting. I've people, confusing. My loan officer directs others. As 10/15, discontinued loan month. documentation around sitting waiting them. They courtesy keeping loop process. recommend communicate clearly timely manner. 

Their mortgage department horrible! pre-approval Sep. 1st immediately started application. 4 weeks after, finally email asking documents. Send everything within 24 hours, agent again. Never email phone call. My closing date 10/14, 10/13, title anything them. Nobody knows going tomorrow. Called customer service answers. This horrible had. After seeing horrible stories reviews, decided immediately another mortgage up. can't risk further them. 

Undoubtedly worst loan processing & underwriting 40 years purchasing properties various states. Our loan processor vacation (or somewhere) Thursday Oct 1, 2020 business days loan Oct 7 return Oct 6. No covered file absence following Monday Oct 5, days closing date. It file looked underwriting Oct 6. unable loan approval (though provided) Oct 7, missed closing date postponed Oct 9. On Oct 8 asked documents underwriting provided within minutes. On Oct 9, waited asked additional information (which included previous day) hours provided documents promptly. underwriting failed loan approval postponed closing date. We excellent readily produced 20% payment title waiting close. That today Oct 10. We postpone moving arrangements sellers going obtain loan all. Our rate lock expires execute loan assured everything fine. All due fault ours, pure incompetence underwriting. 

My husband applied VA refinance May. At first, given laundry things needed. We immediately required documents asked anything needed. The no, review. We due COVID, closing August 2020. We asked anything needed meantime no. The date loan expected close, another laundry returned promptly. asked "they processing now" date. Then lock expire needed paperwork needed points. (original application NO points!) We tried couldn't anywhere didn't return calls matter. When emailed asking someone higher up, due COVIID. Weeks 10/8/2020, STILL waiting loan process. NOW rerun timeframe expired. This dinged lack response drop. We Leukemia, awaiting Bone Marrow transplant losing Leukemia, stress NOT higher excuses lamer. There NO closing date! NEVER seen slow. given proof situation simply opinion. Long waits phone anyone met happening "Processing". Emails seldom returned phone messages. With application 125 days, God knows "processing". Other companies around COVID assist customers seems used excuse. Homebuyers beware! 

Big Mistake going PENFED. Worst customer communication EVER! We contacted August locked rate September November 1 closing. 30 days later, underwriting, response multiple emails. So another lender provided excellent responsiveness matched rate, refunded appraisal fees charged without replying communications. 

Horrible Experience! existing customer wanted purchase them. attracted competitive rates. So preapproved mortgage, signed contract, paperwork, $500 appraisal appraisal good. Then 3 weeks later deny application because 2 years history!!! 2 weeks closing date starting zero, really couldn't beginning!. So unprofessional! They respond calls emails, seen worst customer service bank. 

Card Online Banking: given stars could. cash reward card. If online banking purchases payments luck. 65 years years banking I've used posting slow. Normally cards immediate posting payments purchases validate same. You online account reflect banking possible. Although account states $0.00 balance 10/5/20.. pending payments purchases haven't registered according online account 9/29 10/1. Complaining because customer service reps supervisors blame "third system" uses corrective action taken. Perhaps posting delay helps holding balances. 

Buyer Beware! PFCU Mortgage Department currently awful! My refinance it's closing date underwriting 7 weeks. I've personnel demands. They haven't provided closing date. actually 2 months ago. They weeks closing well. almost contract buyer due gross negligence. responsible mortgage lender cater military, meeting closing dates. The email correspondence empathetic personalized. It's sad exemplified honor, integrity responsibility. 

product... really apply. This terrible bank. It banking 1970s like. They incredibly slow, website useless impossible use, publish rates suck impossible actually get. tried online account website keeps removing digit account verify. perfect turned loan well. Use Navy amazing customer service Capital One yield savings accounts. You 4 days trying something accomplish PenFed. 

Worse customer service experienced 50 years planet. As monday 9/28/2020 looking another company. No mas! 

I’m seller vehicle purchase members. Loan approved 09/11, loan buyer. ???? 

Locked refi rates July. Initially, everything Loan officer, responded promptly called back. Decided 30 days. Loan officer Mortgage processor us. She ended emailing finally called us. He requested documents, documents day. Email 1 wk update, respond, email 3 days. He its underwriting because overloaded. 60 lock rate expired update regarding loan close. sending email supervisor lack communication. Still response supervisor. Got fed different company. honestly really disappointed PenFed. understand overloaded valid excuse providing subpar service. 

Applied 7/14 happened Loan Officer(LO) return calls. My Loan processor (LP) questions Docs i loan. guessed documents need. Had hybrid appraisal valued undervalued, comparable, stated garage added because, "garage carport door." Disputed appraisal added sq ft. but, comp sq ft. Was $499 pocket appraisal but, appraisals errors correct. How incorrect well? 8/24, received denial letter. The information checked " collateral sufficient". Since appraisal $100.000 equity LO stated correct. Emailed LO LP information. LP emailed LO. called LO LP because, information. Informed emailed advised contact her. reasons given guessed denied. LTV. LO denied because, LTV 80% 80.1. LP stated email 7 days prior paying loans mortgage payment LTV 80%. She "oh, email." So, email prior. That's acceptable.Debt income ratio. This guess. asked non-taxable income "grossed up". She grossed income but, underwriter it. asked underwriter grossed income no. My question. WHY? It standard banking gross non-taxable income works thousands veterans I'm isn't issue. Does gross-up? because, loan department doesn't. The LO repetitively application but, documents already submitted. asked can't happening instead starting again. On 8/27 i LO supervisor business. It's 9/24 contacted returned multiple calls. really wanted but, nightmare. Things disorganized, lack communication, emails replied to. The guessing staff happened easily taken staff trained, communicated another organized. If loan denied because, LTV 1/10 percent requirement loan but, closing, told, reevaluate loan process. 

Great service loan easy % easygoing terms easy .</p> 

Congratulations you're approved loan Septembers 7th. It's September 16th communication. No clue receiveing its coming how. After holding time, informed packet. Still receiving packet? 

Love it. This customer service. surprised customer service experienced month. 

If negative stars recommend everyone lending institution banking needs. worst I’ve company, lending institution. When opening account, representative multiple mistakes asked documentation previously provided multiple times. Further, representative stated weeks weeks due representative’s delay incompetence. should’ve taken representative’s incompetence indication things come, couple weeks into didn’t another bank. However, should’ve started because would’ve saved doing so. After opening equity credit, policy wires longer used access equity checks used instead. However, provides checks, issue project requires multiple people/companies. In addition, doesn’t ordering checks via its online portal. Instead, PenFed’s customer service line. So, calling its customer service waiting hours representative, representative informed equity closed. asked didn’t know. mistake, he’d transfer another department. However, didn’t transfer another department instead transferred prompts initially called. followed prompts equity department waiting disconnected PenFed’s automated customer service line. Needing access funds equity credit, called waited 3 hours 35 minutes someone. While you’re waiting, estimated someone jumps seemingly random minutes, tries ones sanity. For me, jumped 200 minutes 63 minutes 117 minutes 45 minutes 72 minutes handful minutes, none actually wait. When finally reached someone 3 hours 35 minutes, representative informed account closed. So asked additional checks access funds equity she’d so. However, received skeptical checks come. To icing cake, received notification account suspended making online payments. In sum, someone else, anyone banking needs yourself consternation having PenFed. 

This 5 horrible banking customer service. 179 minutes rep phone knowledge all. All needed mortgage payoff refinance loan. Awful customer service!!! 

existing banking mortgage customer. In May applied refi. They 90 closing date August. turned docs within weeks. August went. They telling "due Covid, rates, overwhelmed". The rate lock expired, closing sight. Loan officer's great, apparently processing/underwriting department non-existent. I'm refinancing another lender. 

Comes checking account. An Unexpected. 

*I zero stars could.... bumbling lack professionalism. purchased, sold refinance homes years (not mention being licensed realtor states), companies process/turnaround ridiculous! "I haven't conversation complaint CFPB 8/19/20. During conversation wanted expedite/preserve application, addition resolving complaint. This loan application delayed Processing/Underwriting additional 3 months (total 4 months, 4/29/20). As remember, loan fully documented one, initial delay due required thru appraisal (no appointments month/covid 19), desktop shuffle different processors (one month, additional documents)? Finally, It's sitting Underwriting department 2 months (no additional document requests)? In case, reached 8/25/20, response? Based conversation 8/19/20, promised Underwriting couldn't extension deadline? tried contact occasions previously, avail, complaint? . point, obviously deadlines expired, I'm authorizing another report.... When reimbursement appraisal fee?" 

Minimal overdraft protection line. Access America fees excessive can’t cancel lose average accounts 

opened savings acct online mail toll-free number. When called representative asked SSN Card, Utility Bill image driver's license. Why required now? didn't opened account. Actually asked security questions online online application. Absolutely unacceptable decided cancel requested return deposit electronic ACH union. 

They loans customers without report pull. The rates maximum borrowing amount compared SoFi Marcus GS 

A awesome financial need. Their smoothest. forever. 

Even member years, previous mortgage them, exceptional rating, received customer service applied mortgage. After weeks barrage questions (one answered prompt more), closer getting approval closing date. It’s almost pretend loan don’t. Also customer service. Phone calls emails returned. Low rates avoid pain. 

advertises constantly loans & sounds marvelous, luck trying apply one. No return email calls. It leads end. complaints others. Very disappointing! Don’t waste time!! 

A professional fast. highly recommend banking needs. From application day. 

After making monthly payment, takes 10 days update available card. Very inconvenient!!!! 

Excellent starting limit, excellent customer service , loan rates customers, highly recommend anyone edgy fits criteria aren’t easy worth savings account 5 bucks 

Very helpful; fast. Showed moving tedious forward. Other mortgage companies, experience, slower responsive 

AWFUL with. They continuously misinformation, hoops application. GO ANYWHERE ELSE. 

Great bank, customer service, rates. Never issues, customers reaching based definite bonus. 

Terrible service Can activated CC business another phone numbers turned 2 1/2 years

Terrible customer service. Closed Account. Never received anything PenFed...............................................................

Majic jack Phone bill, renewal page. So because PenFeds Myopic thinking Asinine policy making. purchase phone minimum 6 contract bill online. Pull ASS Penfed. 

Easy transaction quickly. Easy account payments. They answers calls most. Very loan. 

20 years, going military. 20 years failed times. The issue unable deliver functioning mobile app. This longer luxury requirement. Paying bills using mobile app works maybe 10% app usually requires 2-3 restarts transactions. After complaining "web browser works fine". web browser works - mobile app doesn't work... tolerant bugs apps gong 2 years. The app garbage. Where $60 per online bill-pay fee go? The issue applied approximately 5 times 20 years denied 4 occasions - simply visited another bank, applied approved case. The odds getting loan odds winning lottery. Several friends colleagues experience. Why member cannot credit? Next comes fraud detection department associated process. doing banking another institution now, business account personal account - debit locked due activities. PenFed's fraud detection equivalent helicopter keeping dangers walking grassy field. It's constant nuisance caused issues trying something switch another (from another bank) because locked. Why suddenly locked often? The concern excessive advertising does. It strikes overly focused recruiting members instead keeping ones have. It you've - I'm out. 

Discrimination. Discrimination. Discrimination. Customer service sales department apologizing, racial profiling backstopping approved cases paperwork tapes... 

No good, sucks money. This 12.49% rate considerably lower cards, it's money. 

Easy provided. My favorite times. Good website excellent customer service phone too. 

Need laugh? Try union. They bombard emails apply because member. They email apply. Even down. Only credit. They actually hurt applying. received reputable companies Discover Citibank. treat paper. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME PenFed. This sucks plus rude you. contacting me, member anymore :-( 

We forever. It cash have, giving 5 percent cash purchases. This card. 

Tienen ofertas agresivas oferta, los trámites para solicitar préstamos tarjetas de fácil acceso tienes que esperar tanto tiempo y te exigen tantos documentos 

This helping lowering monthly expenses. It allows budget loans cards. 

Gracias por la oportunidad de ser parte de ustedes estoy muy agradecido y gustaría seguir haciendo negocio con ustedes los recomendaría 

The , rates low. trusting giving opportunity taking loan. 

PFCU personal loan paid March 2020, zero balance, payment each, payment 

called update loan application. Was asked signing member first? guess, finished ok loan denied? When asked Experian why. I’ve denied loans past, someone false that’s going now. And someone giving loan decision. I’ll cancel membership another “military friendly” place. 

CU back, When needed increase, rate reduction alway worked me. Very military friendly. 

Great Union. Easy communicate easy answer. They emails fast. Nicest people. Anytime maneuver website something particular, they've guided solution. 

This offers excellent everything! From easy website,excellent offerings galore. 

member 20 years appreciate customer relations, applied fix things around home, They approved 25 seconds 

One worst unions Auto Loan. Their GAP insurance practices exceptionally deceiving agent mention insurance cancelled 60 days. 

The worst customer service. The worst automatic system. The long, someone answers, talk, nothing. 

recommend everyone. definitely finance another Penfed. Next looking daughter house. Penfed, members. 

I'm disappointed Union. HELOC decided account. When opened HELOC another organisation paid balance, additional $192 lien release fee appeared. wasn't aware it. CC notify fee. Initially, fact, into savings account "loan excess amount"! stuff incorrect transaction confused me. Later lien release fee $91 instead $192. But connection clerks slowed down. wouldn't recommend organisation because fees aren't stated clearly beginning. 

easy with, good. My averaged 800 across 3 agencies rates personal loan. My CL CC started 20K 12 mo. 0% bal. trans. well. Pretty customer believe. All CU compared Navy banks. 

I've banking starting 2016 I've customer friendly treated really respect. recommend anybody scores awesome card. 

Long plus changed rules. If 850 dropped 15% rate. Even 840 applies. Previously 12% bracket. 

The rates none painless!!! adjustments explained difference amount paying approval amount approved within 5 minutes. Thank service. 

Just atrocious. They refused reverse fradulent charges card. Ended pulling $16k personal checking tooth nail back. Still fighting charges reversed. Piss customer service, worse f******* planet. Stay far, away. 

Nice card. BUT...18 months, lates, missed,very amount owed($85 $1000 limit) 2-3 x minimum due offered increase. Could &lt; 28% across cards, scores 700s. ??? Go figure.... 

really situation approved loan. Thanks!................. 

acquired loan PenFed. Sent title vehicle waiting 2 months it. Meanwhile variable apr loan perfected title ones paperwork title forms filled out. Absolutely ridiculous. WILL NEVER GET A LOAN WITH THEM AGAIN!!! 

Terrible customer service human. Wish minus 0 stars. because customer service. 

loans (and banks) stellar. In semblance customer service longer reasonable option mortgages HELOCs. A things (all breakers me) —they answering service now. The service virtually questions ability employee —Penfed employees seldom respond anymore emails...and it’s makes useless —Penfed appears backlogged lack properly docs. My docs mistakes closing (delayed 6 weeks due incompetence) another closing days. Their rates good. Their service avoid then. 

A repairs that's it's loans hopefully paid 

best, switched USAA because treated different products offered me. switch! 

They refinance loan would. They lower rate loan ratio. 

Horrible auto-loan experience. Pretty along others qualify scam. Will pursue case. Not worth insult, business elsewhere “claims” deal. 9/22 - Called confirm advertisement auto loan. (1.49% Interest!) 9/23 - Approved loan (promotional rate 1.49%) 9/30 - Received loan promotional rate - 1.49% 10/26 - Arrived dealership. Called confirm ensure promotional rate 1.49%. Confirmed. Bought brand (36 month) confirmed rate 1.49%. Called arriving home—once sure. 11/4 - My auto-loan shown 1.99% officially web. Saw online promotional rate 1.99%. Called rectify. Was department review. 11/6 - Received - Apparently promotional rate changed Oct. 15th 1.99%. First because dealership cashed November; claimed promotion changed Oct. 15th (okay? How suppose that...their “you weren’t”). Told honor previous promotion. 1. Operator rate changed called Oct. 26th dealership. mentioned multiple times using PenFed’s services advantage promotional rate 1.49%. Instead entire previous promotion surprised 1.99%. 2. After “reviewing” entire recorded calls/ conversation, clearly lacks sympathy. They falsely I’d qualify 1.49%. understand didn’t phone calls prior to/post purchase, exchanged 5 phone calls lasting 20-40 minutes operator “bait trap” avoided. speculated something happen, wanted sure, numerous phone calls everything understand advertisement/promotion. Even promotion changed Oct. 15th, used issued Previous promotion. My constantly checking website everyday, My trusted “confirmations” received operator, minutes purchasing vehicle. Pretty is, doubt anything/everything you, worst scenario trust financial cases.. 

By rates, customer service wonderful sweethearts, times issues requests. This used, transferred stuff over. 

Their rewards, forget customer service. calling Pentagon. 

This CC DISOVER IT card. It generously provides points acquire applied Amazon Debit Card purchases, Debit Cards. Most importantly provides generous $50000 limit.

Using turns quickly into rewards. recently $50 Starbucks . There different types rewards lots gift cards 

Great service accomplish without hassle banking institution I've encountered 5stars 

Probably happened qualify scam resources pursue case. called loan agreed monthly payments. revived quickly different terms attached. The rate higher wanted loan. called managers according "the senior review cannot grant initial terms" because CS representative "attempt" explain rate(s) different. When asked because recall CS mentioned rates monthly payment duration loan, refused privacy grounds. Yet, listened confirmed understand view! Deceiving false advertising. In retrospect I'm refused loan loan another institution 2 points lower interest. closed accounts depositing checks elsewhere. 

Do it. solicited ME, approved JULY 26, 2019. 2 1/2 weeks later, card. They multiple applications re-issued another card. HUH? TO THIS DATE OF AUGUST 26, 2019, STILL NO CARD! They stated mailed 20th August, shut stating "I" asked closed. NOW, THEY WANT ME TO RE-OPEN!. MOST IMPORTANTLY, THEY SCREWED MY CREDIT SCORE A "MINUS 30 POINTS”! PRISTINE A+ CREDIT!! TODAY, called asked stupidvisor, supervisor omg cannot into words.. DO NOT DO BUSINESS HERE. DON’T DO IT! PERIOD. 

PROS: Staff nice helpful CONS: Their website sucks - confusing. 5 plus years overseas year. EVERY traveled overseas blocked preregister dates countries traveling in. My hacked TWICE 4 months (which control) 5-7 days reset fraud text alerts card. To matters worse autopay (to statement balance) usually ends charging balance TWICE. Once because having manual payment autopay kicks in. Believe tried different ways avoid ALWAYS happens. They fees (which forgive making payments time) 4 phone calls agency card. When hacked SEPARATE request comes blistering 5 days (so usually week). given requesting cc. My husband Discover points none hassles. 

I've Checking customer given 5 Stars website category. Today ended today. NSF ACH transfer. immediately into local deposited $400 cash error. complained $30 NSF fee. Now, deposit shows unavailable funds 9 business days. I'm waiting deposit unavailable status account including mother's account contains retirement funds. customer service reps fix 9 business hold, concur different security department feels anything customers. That's business. 

BEWARE- They / SSN# because $5 membership fee. This divulged online process. They stated consent form/page indicates this. They stated another loan application. stated report pulled 24 hours ago. Bottom line- They pulled $5 membership fee...debited $5...didn't email confirmation above. Had transferred multiple agents supervisor finally granted request remove/cancel "membership" return $5. What waste effort. 

clearly they're doing comes loans. started $45K loan MBA, 5 years paid $15K. When checked balance due year, MORE loan amount. After doing research, miscalculated payments wasn't paying month. Their DOUBLE monthly payment up, mistake. In addition, reviewed transaction history, applying portion monthly payment towards principle, instead applying towards interest...hence balance down. They multiple "technical errors" recently caused scheduled automatic payments 3 consecutive months, resulting myself (and - cosigner loan) reported bureaus, causing scores significantly. 3 letters 3 months answers errors continued happen, request forgiveness loan, reduced rate. After getting responses 2 letters, Vice President department. That ago, response. decided calling today, I've 58 minutes!! member years, relationship them, getting loan seeing mistakes damage caused family, getting response offers fix errors, WORST lender experienced. 

Worst dealt 40 years banking. They approved auto loan, paperwork sign. Signed paperwork including notarized note. They snailmail 4 weeks later saying didn't notarized note. So another notarized immediately. 1 later request notarized document, 3rd time, notarized in. They informed rate didn't 3 different copies notarized document them. Now February 2019, requested document ..... FOR THE FORTH TIME !!! Not gross incompetence FRAUD ... beginning later. If 0 stars would. 

The WORST to. My fully paid tried apply equity loan. My worth $700000 asked $150000 remodeling. They apply re-apply promising sure, cosign excellent credit. And significantly lowered wife's inquiries denied it. The month, promising update "tomorrow" day. TERRIBLE, DO NOT GO THERE. 

Fed's mortgage horrible extremely least. This worst I've lender. Their departments communicate another communicate realtors customers involved. When communicate you, documentation you've already supplied numerous times changes you. They asked month's mortgage payment closing (Who that???)! The closing date contract absolutely meaning loan officer, processor underwriter, going time. Even closing nice. The loan officer handled Kary Justiniano Virginia. recommend worst enemy. BEWARE!! 

horrible company. They placed forced insurance mortgage. That fine, because insurance payment stopped noticed. But noticed it, called insurance activated November 21, 2018. On January 17, charged forced insurance! And remove insurance! 

Teller opened account Mgr. deleted entry statement. Teller 5 days debit turned her. Tellers opening account was, it! He forgot account anothers account.

When getting A N Y service B E W A R E MEAN ANY PRODUCT FROM PENTAGON FRDERAL CREDIT UNION. longer decided looking into purchasing home. At ways getting things sttaight. Again, b e w r e manager business practices!!!!!!! One God Abraham, Isaac Jacob God going repay faces. personally followers Lord Jesus Christ pray organization business. 

elsewhere equity loan. From incredibly communication terrible non existent. The loan takes days return begun. The phone waiting 20 minutes. Then transfered times. The working signing. Overall really advise anyone equity loan penfed. 

actually complaint horrible know. Every loan process, 2 employees mistake causing significant problems. It none agents actually going works. Every someone something me, another agent correctly without fail wrong. When supervisor response basically "sorry that's work, end" MULTIPLE agents information prior problem. 

PenFed's website customer service options worthless. They insist conduct relevant business. Their hours availability awful. They zero fucking consideration overseas. hate tacks eyes another dollar. 

VietNam 1968 joined tne union. financed loans cards 50 years. equity loan expire. asked personal loan $15000 balance longer off. The PFCU apply reapply checked lowered 40 points. Then loan equity loan. tried explain loan...No understand that. hads 50 years late. asked being VETERAN payments. VETERANS DO NOT GET ANY BREAKS. If veteran, member, friend, DO NOT dealings PFCU. 

From terrible PenFed. If someone, 20+ minutes. anyone considering them- DON'T DO IT! Such headache. Finally closed account today, they're worth it. 

Their rates competitive. mortgage Penfed. My mortgage rate reset offered lower rate via email rate competitive reset be. Apparently, missed (45 days rate reset) lock lower rate. Good luck finding rate reset date anywhere without pulling 5 years ago. customer service supervisor completely inflexible saying missed 4 days anything. Now refi bank/credit union. The program retain customers. Well losing life....over 4 days. Well Penfed. 

Over 7 8 years issue recently issue. The problems initial times customer 10-20+ minutes, resolving reasonable amount time, rude customer reps. Basically, 3 transactions processed cards.

Customer factor here. on.

THEY MAKE YOU FEEL LIKE YOU HAVE BAD CREDIT AND MAKE YOU FEEL LIKE YOU DON&#039;T KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING KEEP ASKING THE SAME DOCUMENTS JUST TRY TO WORD IT DIFFERENCE. THIS THE LAST TIME I&#039;LL DO BUSINESS WITH PENFED. I&#039;M CLOSING MY CREDIT CARD WITH THEM & MORTAGE WILL BE PAID IN A YEAR. THEY CAN&#039;T HAVE NO MORE OFF MY BUSINESS. IT&#039;S TO MANY CREDIT UNIONS & BANKS OUT HERE TO BE DEALING WITH THIS BSING AROUND CREDIT UNION. A COMPANY HAVE TO EARN MY MONEY....

Make withdraw money. 5000 maximum period. Very tedious with. No mention transferring problem. Would again. 

We duped PedFed. We 1% cash 2009. Just today changed "terms service" 2013 instead being "1% cash reward" being "3% purchases". They letter, recall seeing anything it, I'm thinking "minor fact" burred print. STAY AWAY FROM PenFed, apparently deceitful organization completely cash program clearly notify nerve issue title being "Cash Reward" clearly changed being "Gas Rewards" card. disappointed PedFed, organization this...we shutting account PedFed ASAP. 

filed application dysfunctional warn others company. They weeks processors already appraisal done. When going another bank, charged $743 doing anything us. Would lender pole. dealt dozen banks none incompetent

Stay 

I'm closing days closing costs jumped 18 25 grand. The loan officer someone mistake fixed was. This happening 3 DAYS closing trying anyone loan officer gotten return calls. 

PFCU offers rates, customer service poor, particularly comes equity mortgage products. They doing. They documents piecemeal fashion asking documents once. They arrogant business important them. strongly recommend away them, You rates financial institutions, service. 

This starter ! 

Great Cash reward card. No Fee specific accounts PFCU. You can't 5% either. 

well--for 5000 points earned $50 gift card----BUT--- redeem 5880 points card!! So--thats 18% (17.6) charge!!. Applied charge--your "3x" points grocery NOT 3% --its 2.46% (3% minus 18%(.54 points!). Very clever gimmick---if downright faulty advertising. 

My husband offered become due military service. At came, living foreign although access traditional (local) banks, comfortable putting foreign bank. truly that. The customer service representatives helpful resolve issues. We enjoy customer service, computer system. We lose misplace midnight. The signup easy 5 minutes confident secure are. We really intend anywhere else. 

The Platinum Rewards entry decent credit. If credit, probably rates, rewards, perks, point. The reward bonus spent nice, 5% reward purchases nice. If used purchases highly recommend it. 

Can't account you're in. You comply legal requirements hoops. They comply Section 326 USA PATRIOT Act. Representatives fax sent. 1. There requirement Section 326 ID 2. There fax capable color! 

CREDIT UNION This utter worst account. closed 4 days. Applied Card 807 Score asked, Notarized copies S.S, I.D recent bill, provided them, days asked copied stubs. thru STUPID formalities anyone. called hell cancelled account. WORST BANK ... Please waste energy... 

No Option 1 star.. Worst customer service. Don't waste time.. There 100's banks US...... No response ur mails, opening checking account takes almost 2 months unless them.. waiting Customer service 15 mins 

The rewards associated terrible. because airport lounge visits. The terms changed 2 lounge visits spent $15K. To benefits, activation code "lounge club" quarterly basis! So $15K April, means you'll sometime July - I'm waiting it's mid-July. After spending 45 minutes phone customer service - disconnected! strongly recommend NOT getting cash rewards card. $15K spent $150 1% cash rewards - 3 lounge visits. Why trouble? Hopefully mistake decision get. 

The Platinum Rewards Visa Signature nice rewards features. rewards purchases groceries, although means big, one-time purchases tickets appliances earning maximum rewards. prefer rewards programs cash instead points redeemed, redeemed something Visa gift (which basically cash). Rates fees sort standard stuff card, really stands positive there's Foreign Transaction Fee. USAA World Mastercard traveling foreign transaction fee kills me. I've seen 3% cards, 0% Platinum Rewards great. Overall positives negatives, rewards program structured differently--that great. 

We used auto loans. Their rates consistently available. The application super-quick, approval all. There couple times unable loan them, options purchase. We customers, recommend auto needs. 

Penfed! victim severe identity theft couple years personal info sold criminals across world, account I've hacked...except Penfed! here. Their customer service reps extremely friendly helpful game. trust 100%. Highly recommended. 

This rewards supermarkets. While cards Chase Freedom reward categories, card. The APR high, reward cards entire balance. What 0 APR 12 months. This without annual fee nice. Honestly you're looking reward supermarket habits further. This oozing benefits fees (except apr). 

card! You earn decent amount points used purchases. There's balance transfer rate 2.99% 12 months now, that's low. However Discover IT recently offered 0% balance transfers 18 months. There's cash advance fee, rates cash advances somewhat low. This someone wants accumulate points gift cards benefits trading points. 

member 2011. received excellent customer service checking account. member Armed Services account employer. Opening account easy questions answered appropriately. The issued I’ve encountered being secure financing Union. It probably vehicle looking financing products. 

Union. It's service members immediate service members. Over years I've used them, I've experiences them, They friendly setting account, explaining different features services available you. I've Checking, Cards, loan it's lovely time. Low rates, hidden fees, they're transparent everything, shows customer. If into union, trying bank, you'll find. 

The Platinum Rewards Visa Signature Card travel. You earn points purchases. You earn points purchases, points supermarket purchases, everything nice lot. They nice grace period. The APR high, ones higher. Also balnce transfer APR gets dropped balance transfer onto card. YOu benefits card. If card. 

years now. They rewards qualify. If American Express Black Card amazing deals packages etc. The security account notch, times almost much. access account pin, gain access also. The customer service excellent. Every issue helpful. If looking notch security customer service, definitely go. 

The Platinum Rewards Visa Signature Card average average credit. The rate great, rewards program good, although better. 1% rewards purchases celebrate, 3% rewards supermarket purchases useful, food. 5% rewards sounds great, easily achieve greater rewards applying directly (e.g. Valaros Card). 

The Platinum Rewards offers perks benefits cardholders earn rewards using card. Not earn 1 per spent purchases, earn supermarket purchases. As added benefit, cardholders access premier golf benefits something that’s offered Citi Thank You Preferred card. One 9.99% regular rate. A lower rate incredible nice. 

PenFed's rewards program mediocre best. Sure, earn ton points groceries. But redeem them, turns around devalues earned points its whim. You longer redeem points 100:1 rate expect. 

This military union, I, civilian, donating fee military campaign military families. fee $15, allowed husband account apply loans, etc too. LOWEST rates find, customer service outstanding! 4 stars, due paperwork husband switched names titles vehicle. It straightened out, convenience really compared THOUSANDS saved years. 

handle mine's banking Union. Let you, hands nicest unions there. Getting signed painless process, they're disclosure. No hidden fees anything that. You careful bigger banks sometimes. They personal delight banking. Good rates, fees, impeccable customer service perfect you're eligible. 

Good good. There's features rewards card. Nice reward incentives, rate, 24/7 concierge service! That's value. The downside it's accepted unlike Discover Rewards card. 

This good. 

The Platinum Rewards Visa Signature Card fantastic accepted. Very rate, amazing rewards, balance cash advance fees. Compare Capital One Journey rate twice much, rewards points, higher fees things Cash Advances. If card, hesitate. You better. 

PFCU. used "traditional bank" noticed fees piling that, times, fees mistake. That "proof" mistake. Normally, met condescending employees treated criminal calling mistakes. Forget that. working PFCU wouldn't regular anything! 

This looks rewards card. Compared Discovercard, lots opportunities earn points Platinum Rewards card. You earn points things daily routine - example, earn 5 points per $1 spent purchases. For me, takes nearly $40 tank that's 200 points! intro APR rate 4.99% 2 years. My discovercard lower APR rate year. Awesome! 

Looks Platinum Rewards Visa Card card. The rewards feature nice appears cash bonuses. currently discover gives cash percents takes forever really amount cash back. 

rewards card. You ton points items everyday groceries, we're going buying. There's annual fee appealing transfer APR rates. This reminds New York & Company because theres points spending rewards used overall spending. definitely recommend families. 

Compared HSBC platinum appreciate lower APR Platinum Rewards Visa Signature® Card 25 grace period. Also lack Foreign transactions fees plus trips! 

If i'd use! Chase Citi cards paying rotating based quarterly 5% categories. With 5% 3% grocery's rotate cards. The rates lower cards well, however, actually afford. The Chase Citi cards bonus initial purchases. However, benefits weighs far! 

using FCU Visa years cash I've compared to. 5% purchases, 2% groceries, 1% everything else. Now cash rewards Amazon gift cards, VISA prepaid cards, options. Also, irregular spending instantly further holder calls unlock account. Before traveling, online notify future vacations aware being used locations hassle being declined. Very card. Very service. 

The 4.9% rate balance transfers higher cards I've seen. Though cards 0% rates balance transfers usually rate 12 months, 4.9% looks rate transfers based prime rate actually 13.99%, attention initial 3% fee balance transfer. This confusing looking 9.99 variable rate normally charges. The maximum penalty being 17.99% something tends payments. I've seen cards max penalties 29.99%. Additionally, $25 fee lower cards, $35-40 per payment. The reward points typical reward-point oriented cards. 

opened savings account approved Platinum Cash Rewards Visa. already checking account stuff place. This debit card. The simple. The state. can't into deposit. My husband member joined inconvenient. We transfer funds local account savings account. 

recently opened savings account (after going hoop via donations). The account fairly APY standard compared branches, tons neat features account. For example, there's savings calculator tracker updates transfer into saving account, you'll financial goal. There various materials understand savings accounts features, nice well. 

recommend union. They aren't local, amazing. They willing lend amounts money, hoops. It in, treat right. 1.99% loans. them. 

member years, going service member United States Army. with. The customer service wonderful assume resolution wonderful well. Of course, cannot because Pentagon! Their rates loans, vehicle loans lowest anywhere website incredibly user friendly, applying loan couldn't easier. things guys! 

Use card. It gives 5% cash purchases, exceptions. Without doubt period. You hoops card- membership requires DOD employment being affiliate organization. Also, crazy approval. Expect fax mortgage statements statements paystubs them, times. Still, hoops worth nation's card. 

This seems okay. I'm surprised initial points offer. Rewards cards getting competitive it's it's offered. Points somewhat reasonable regular rate, nice 0% APR intro rate 18 months balance transfers. This attractive. Though intro rate seems odd initial points offer. The Complimentary 24/7 Concierge Service nice sort thing. They benefits, anything honestly. 

The Platinum Reward enticing. The 9.99% rate 0% balance transfers 18 months. The cash advance rate regular rate uncommon cards, feature. Who wants cash advance purchase? My rewards system. typically hate rewards prefer cash rewards BoA rewards card. 

The Platinum Rewards Card really perks distinguish companies. While intro apr, standard rate 9.99% reasonable. higher bonus points purchases, become expensive. It rewards things often. 

This cards mind( America Rewards Card) points purchases. used The Rewards Card really handy then. The 9.99% APR cash advances isnt either. recommend friends family. 

A cards stations limited rewards fees rates. Besides that, used company's gas. The Platinum Rewards Card ideal sick getting almost cards. Five points per spent highest I've seen doesn't limit gasoline company. Even beneficial that, wherever want! It Visa network used plenty places. Besides rewards, points per groceries incredible! Use things you'll anyway- gas, groceries, on, excellent rewards! 

Receive 5 points per purchases annual fee? Yes please! This definitely highest rewards purchases I’ve seen, giving decent amount points groceries – consistent purchases. 

My husband needed selling into reliable, safe, secure bank. We gotten discouraged banks decided instead. Since living Washington, DC time, tried CU. First off, extremely easy account online. stepped inside union, online presence fabulous! Second, deposit money, Union, network unions. We deposit switched into account day! Third, rates time, guys leader rates savers. And lastly, ability because union, transfer without banks needed. Overall, based customer service, available accounts, online banking. They deserve stars. 

The Platinum Rewards users looking for, balance rewards solid APR. If qualify highly recommend it, interested using regular necessities grocery shopping. The rewards worthwhile introductory fee kick letting without overpaying. 

really Platinum Rewards card. You decent qualify definitely worth it. Compared cards qualifications rate 10 percent slightly higher. My America Premium 8.5 percent card. Even cards horribly cash advance rate usually around 25 percent 10 percent. It rewards system. 5 points stations, 3 points super everything else. All yearly fee extra looking good. In it. 

About 10 years stationed Kadena Air Base Okinawa, Japan really fed BoA due crazy ATM fees. Luckily me, promptly switched to. since, looked back. The customer service, promptly expressed almost situation ratified amount time. One prime 2006, stationed England needed quickly deposit months rent (over $3,000 bucks!) The (ran BoA non less) going $200 conversion rates transfer 5 days received it. After phone Fed, instructed dealt strictly pounds day! 

The Platinum Rewards Card excellent option individuals looking transfer balance another card. The offers rate (4.99%) transfers months 2013 (although rate return regular percentage promotional period). The Platinum Card offers lower fee ($25) longer grace (25 days) Chase Sapphire Preferred Card ($35 21, respectively) added benefit. gives its cardholders tickets events 24/7 complimentary concierge service definitely unique bonus. The holiday shopping almost upon The Card consolidate balance splurge Christmas gifts. 

This America largest return supermarket. really compared cash program because it. Another notable plus Platinum Rewards Card annual fee. All looks card. The rate comparable i currently cash advance rate reasonable. My favorite Canada foreign transaction fees. The savings discounts retailers sounds America unlike America offered golf benefits, sporting events, complimentary wine tastings. That, think, really nice feature annual fee. 

This Platinum Rewards Card seems have.Unlike American Express Premier Rewards Gold Card offers annual fee Platinum Rewards Card Travel accident insurance roadside dispatch.This choice someone American Express mentioned.The rewards really really retailers fee countries valuable someone travels outside United States often. 

The Platinum Rewards Card seems mill rewards, doesn’t pizzazz doesn’t reward redemption deals travel, probably isn’t choice traveler (unlike American Express card). However, everyday uses; rewards 3 points per grocery purchases 5 points per purchases, really – life. This lower regular rate 9.99%, lower rates I’ve seen while. 24/7 concierge service, really plus. It’s nice someone questions; services granted. 

The Platinum overall. The rate 10 percent mediocre compared some. You 1200 dollars supermarket earn 25 Gap card. (https://www.penfedplatinumrewards.com) My Chase earns amount points they're worth dollars. However Platinum cash advance rate, 10 percent I've seen. Altogether rates rewards you. 

The terms decent. Platinum Rewards Card competitive comparing cards. They really rewards. Though it's complicated understand, terms you'll understand easily. It's really times we're definitely lower class. they're giving cards there, definitely recommended list. The rates dealt with. But you'll household needs stuff without worries. 

The Platinum Rewards Card competitive compared cards category. They decent balance transfer rate although seen zero percent 18 months. They rewards allows members earn places grocery station. They annual fee excellent apply. This limit customer economic times. Overall, offering. However, research, offers there. 

The Platinum Rewards Card offers personally seen comes offering reward points. currently holder Capital One Journey Student Rewards Card. While 1% cash purchases, Platinum gives opportunity earn everyday purchases groceries gas. With card, earn 3 points per spent supermarket purchases 5 points per spent purchases. Considering everybody needs gas, generous offer. The drawback needs ‘excellent’ qualify. My nowhere excellent, therefore attempt apply card. It wouldn't worth risk inquiry I’ll denied.
