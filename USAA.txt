Roadside assistance.... April 16,2021 I am relocating my daughter. Driving a van with a trailer on the back. I am disable veteran with one leg and half a right arm. I ran out of gas. I call Usaa roadside assistance. I'm waiting for a call. This is the conversation: " how much cash do you have", me-" I only have 8 dollars cash but I have a debt card and credit card too", USAA " sorry but I am not coming for 8 dollars". Me " so your are going to leave me stranded. I'm a disable person and I need help. You can follow me to gas station and I will pay you your money ". Usaa " sorry but I am not coming out there for 8 dollars ". My family had to come help me from 2 hours away.  This is USAA roadside service at it's best. Please think long an hard before you purchase roadside assistance. This happened in April 2021 and have heard once from USAA and they tried to offer me 100 dollars to keep quiet.

Arguably, the best cashback card with no annual fee. It was a rare test CC offer by USAA several years ago and they still honor it. Hands down, my favorite!

I love USAA’s American Express card.  I use it for all my gas purchases for a 5% cash back rewards.  And I use it at the base commissary and BX for 5% cash back rewards.

The card is okay, it's dealing with the fraud department and actually getting the app to work that is an issue. I had a fraud charge that didn't get investigated because they didn't receive legible copies of my paperwork even after sending it three times, and I was not informed and told to wait the third time where they finally said sorry it's too late now. Completely ridiculous. Also the app locks up and my payment is never applied when I pay. I have had issues during corona and they said I could get a deferment but waited till it was after my due date to inform me I had to pay the statement balance to get the deferment, and this balance was the balance from the fraud charge that budget rental charged me twice the amount the rental was supposed to cost after charging me three times on another card I put an initial deposit on and they said they didn't receive it. Do not rent with budget rental car! And do not expect the fraud department here to investigate anything because they'll never receive the paperwork even when you submit it from another bank via fax. I really get so overwhelmed that all this is so difficult when I am a simple customer I couldn't imagine having a business account with this and trying to get any assistance. The representatives I have spoken with are generally nice, but the ability to help and answer questions and the clear disorganization I've encountered is not okay and has cost me over 1,200 in fraud charges and late fees I paid because I thought they were actually working on my case and then I thought that I was going to be getting a deferment but didn't get it till afterwards and another late fee for being just passed the date due to coronavirus and not receiving unemployment on time and then not getting an answer through USAA till it was too late.

I have used USAA for 20 yrs and have never filed a claim with them, keep in mind I have my house and 2 trucks and a car with them. Well someone rear-ended me in Miami and they act like I did something wrong, like I am filing a fake claim or something. They bought me the truck is the only reason I am still will them when they ain’t the cheapest for car and home insurance.</p>

USAA Signature VISA is an incredibly good card. Good customer service. I have had this card for many years. Great balance transfer

Loan process was easy. Want a 2% loan rate. Refinancing now with Cardinal financial cashout refinance. Closing costs and fees seem high for VA cash out.Total fees 8000.

This is the most difficult company I have ever had to deal with. It took over a hour online to verify my identity, an additional hour to verify my wife’s identity. After that was done, nothing was actually accomplished. They then requested the same piece of information six separate times and they could see that information on their side but needed the exact same thing again because???  Almost a week after the first contact with the company I have gotten no where.  A pending auto loan application that cannot be submitted until my wife’s identity is confirmed. The only thing they have not requested is blood. Save yourself a lot of time and headache and use ANY other bank. 0 stars wasn’t an option, unfortunately I had to give them one star more than deserved.

USSA VISA has proven a bad credit card - Without notice, USAS changed my Statement Date causing a balance be reported thus causing me a five (5) point reduction in my Credit Score // In addition, USAA does a bad job in responding to a Credit-Dispute - To file requires paper documentation be mail to s Post Office Box, then 30 days to review, forcing the Disputed Amount to be paid-in-full to avoid interest fees, and another drop in Credit Score - By comparison to Capital One - USAA VISA SUCKS!!!

USAA is predatory at best. They charge service members insufficient funds fees on charges that don't clear. Then they repeat the same charge two more times. It's not an overdraft fee as in they paid the overdrawn amount so they are charging you that amount plus a fee. They are charging you an insufficient funds fee. They did not pay anything. It did not cost them anything. Your account just didn't have enough funds for the transaction. Then they run the same charge two more times because obviously if it wasn't there before It's likely not going to be there tomorrow unless it is the first or fifteenth. Predatory.</p>

Okay. USAA. Last September my parents were hit by Hurricane Sally and my father who is bedridden and also on Hospice and mother who is 86 have issues for the obvious reasons. I called on their behalf and submitted a claim, and during the process one of the representatives required that I submit a USAA Power of Attorney form. So to do this I printed the form and had to transport my father (again who is on Hospice and bedridden) to a notary to have this done. Customer service at it's finest. So after doing this task I submitted the USAA POA and now after all that they are saying they don't have it and I will have to fill out a new one. So basically someone has dropped the ball again and obviously I'm not going to drag my father out of his bed to sign something that he already signed and USAA screwed up. I still have the original copy, but this is the WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE under the circumstances.

No upgrade option, tell you it will take weeks to get your security deposit back from a CD that pays almost no interest, would not recommend to anyone

USAA has always provided us a great rate and superior customer service with limited robot access and fast turnaround to a real person.

This was a great experience. I felt somewhat secure knowing that WalletHub was watching my account activities the whole time I was with them.

I've had this credit card since 1990 but it has gone seriously downhill. It's a bummer, used to be great. Security is a big issue. The card is repeatedly compromised and they are unapologetic and they have no sense of customer service. They cancel the card and reissue a new one at the littlest inquiry. They do not care that requires updating all my online CC accounts, and that I have to do without the replacement card for 7-10 days. So no CC for over a week. If you want it expedited, they will charge you for express mail. Many other cards do not do this and get the card to you asap. Also, their online system is difficult to navigate and info is not readily available. Their customer service is in the pits. Instead of spending money on marketing to new members, they need to spend money on security, their website, and customer service.</p>

I  LOVE  my USAA  card..  Outstanding  customer service , great  benefits,  competitive rates, easy  to navigate / use  website &  mobile  app.

So far I'm really satisfied with ussa, I don't have any issues whatsoever, no complaints. Their customer service is very professional.

Great Credit Card, I love it, and USAA makes it easy to manage through their user friendly website. Customer Support is very helpful, and friendly too.

Horrible Service!  The new system with dealer service form instead of sending a check was awful. Pre-approved for a car loan and then given different information each time I called once I found the car.  Took over 2 weeks to get loan processed; USAA employees gave wrong information about forms needed; gave wrong address for dealer to send forms; gave false timelines of when loan would be processed and then timeline for funding loan so dealer would release car. USAA did not support their customer. Will not  be using them again for car loans ever.  Zero stars rating; So disappointed in their service.

Great rewards card! No annual fee and great customer service! Low interest rates. Personalised cards with picture is an option I like.

I sent a check drawn on a USAA Federal saving Bank account ( check no 1004) in the amount of $150,000 to be applied to the principle of my mortgage. The check was mailed on May 3, 2021. I did not see the cashed check, change in mortgage amount or withdrawal from my account. I called on/about May 15 and was told that the company had not received it. I was advised by their associate to stop payment and he connected me to USAA where I reported a lost check. I sent a second check ( no 1006) by priority mail on May 17 for $160,000. That mail was received by Nationstar on May 20. On Jun.1st, I called again because the 2nd check had not been cashed by Nationstar. I was told they would investigate. I called again on Jun.8 and was told they don't have any information. To lose two checks in less than 30 days demonstrates gross incompetence or the possibility of check fraud. By the way, Nationstar labeled the first check NSF. That is not true. I have the funds in my account. I believe this label is an attempt to hide incompetence.</p>

Customer service via USAA is just not good.  I am a transwoman, and today the customer service representative (a female) who was helping me with my checking account, continued to call me "Sir".  I explained to her that I am married, that I have a husband, and that she could call me Kristy.  Instead, she stated that on my profile it has "Mr (first and last name]", but she clearly wasn't having it.  This is humiliating and disrespectful, and it's not the first time I've run into this with USAA.

Had issues with credentials trying to login, had to call support who claimed problem was fixed.  Following month same problems.   Paid off and closed account.

They get you with low interest rates on credit cards and then hike it up to the highest percentage possible and I don’t go for it. Shop around and ask good questions about fluctuating interest rates

This card started as a secured card, after 2 years USAA changed the terms and I can no longer add funds or change to an unsecured.

I’ve been banking with USAA for the last 11 years and that is about to come to a quick and decisive end! I’ve never had a problem until the last couple years they have went straight downhill. For a bank who describes themselves as a for veterans bank they sure don’t care about screwing us over every chance they get. They have now been holding my paycheck for a week and by the time I get it they will have held it for almost two weeks is what they tell me today. In a time when everyone in the country is struggling financially they seem to not care at all if our needs are met or not. We have just turned into numbers with them.</p>

Good card with great customer service. Rates are good. I wish you could add more value to the secured line more easily than the current process</p>

USAA gave me a great rate and the loan amount authorized before going to dealership. It was like showing up with cash to the negotiating table.

I was given a high interest rate when opened and despite several years of ontime payment history, I was advised that USAA does not lower interest rates on their cards based on payment and/or balance history.

USAA used to be the best bank around.  Now they have untrained and incapable people serving us.  For the credit cards they used to take payment history and credit score into account.  Now they give you a $10,000 limit 16-25% APR.  I called four times to try to stop them from sending my closed card statement into my account.  It closed over eight months ago.   USAA came up with a gingle that sounds over the phone, radio, and tv.  Their quality dropped down hard four years ago  the low credit limit damages my credit score so they raised it $3000 which barely helped.   Now I have to wait another six months before they raise it again.   I am considering changing banks away from USAA now.

USAA is a great credit union to be associated with.  They are there to help in every financial situation that could arise.  2 thumbs up!

BEEN A MEMBER FOR OVER 60 YEARS LOVE usaa and the card both of which have responded to my needs in the USA AND OVERSEAS. ALWAYS THERE WHEN I NEED THEM AND THEY CARD MY SECURITY AS WELL BY MONITORING ANY UNUSAL ACTIVITY ON MY ACCOUNT AND CONTACTING WHEN THERE IS ANY.</p>

Disappointed that they do not automatic credit increases and to ask for one is a hard pull on credit. May as well just apply for different card.

USAA no longer cares for the vet.  It's all about protecting themselves with our money.  It has become increasingly harder to login with their added layers of security.  Want to speak to a live person, there are more layers of security after waiting on hold.  Don't remember the answers to your security questions, you have to hang up and call them back and go through the whole process again.  They simply do not demonstrate any desire to help with whatever issue you may be calling about.  Tried the online chat feature, its only a robot,  they won't even allow you speak to a real person.  After many years of giving my banking, and insurance needs to USAA I'm probably going to leave and search for greener pastures somewhere else.

Best card to have so far with no complaints. Would like a higher credit limit but only received a low credit limit due to losing credit score at the time.</p>

This is one of the worst products that USAA has to offer. It will never convert to an unsecured card and they recently stopped allowing the option to add more funds to increase your credit limit. Want to get rid of it but can’t because I’ve had for so long and I don’t want it to hurt my score.</p>

Usaa is a great company to have accounts with they stand behind their customers  and help them anyway they can. Usaa is very honored in my state.

It's been over a year and counting since I told them I didn't accept the policy changes. I've cut-up my card and quit using their card. Unfortunately the card is a joint account and partner didn't mind the changes so USAA refused to remove me from the account. Last I checked, this is a violation of FCRA which USAA doesn't care. I forget which of 2 cards I had with them was a MC originally that they changed to a Visa.

Fast and easy process. Low rates available. Customer service at its finest. Love all the information they gave us ahead of doing the loan.

My mother-in-law has been with USAA for 41 years she has never been late on a payment. She has been in the hospital in a nursing home for almost the last two months. She had come home and is on hospice. like most kids who have to take care of their parents we must learn their bills and due date. I'm confused because she was late they tell me is cancelled but they want to charge a late fee. But they also say she had to do a whole new account now. Then they tell me if we wait 2 weeks for her account to clear that we can redo it and possibly not have to pay the late fee. This makes no sense none at all. They want us to wait two weeks and redo it with no insurance instead of just letting me pay for two months. I personally would never use this company ever. 41 years she's been with them her parents were with them their whole life. Her son I've been with them for 20 years. They're about to lose some good customers

USAA & Wallet Hub are Great Financial Businesses to affiliate with, & I am very blessed & thankful for my credit score rising & USAA Helping me

Good card.  It easy to use and the benefits are welcomed.  I've been a USAA member since 1985 and will continue to be.   Ease of use through their App is great.

1-2% cash back on most of my purchases. Available credit for spending is available as soon as you pay with money from your USAA checking account. Less one star because I haven’t had an auto credit limit increase in years and you have to be in the military or related to someone in the military.</p>

This is a great company and easy to work with. I have let the balance get too high so I try not to use it anymore but with the current monthly payment of $500, it will take about 29 payments to pay it in full.</p>

Very good card and usaa is the best will always have a good rating usaa they're very professional and kind and respect for the customer</p>

Usaa is great but this specific card I cannot get a credit increase so that sucks. There are no annual fees so that’s why I am keeping the card.

USAA is one of the best financial companies on the planet as well as insurance. I highly recommend that company to anyone who can get it.

Great for 0% cash advances if you qualify! USAA mails these offers often and they are usually for 12 or 18 months. Excellent customer service!

This is a great card. Never had any issues. Their customer service is excellent. I would recommend this card to anyone that is a current USAA member</p>

I recently encountered an issue using a USAA credit card that took my credit score from near 800 to 0.  USAA was less than transparent in the 5 months that it took to fix this issue created by them and Experian.  As a military veteran and loyal customer for close to 20 years I thought that I could rely on USAA when starting a small business.  I could not.  USAA is not a friend of military veterans and is certainly not a friend of small business owners. I would give them a zero for customer service, if only that was an option.

Thank you USAA for the service you have given us. With our car insurances and home insurance, you have treated us well. With this fixed personal loan, we really appreciate it.

Avoid their homeowner's insurance. Since I retired from the military and bought my home, I have had USAA insurance for 18 years and am about to replace my second storm-damaged roof out of my own pocket. Without ever paying for any of my storm damage claims, USAA decided to more than double my premiums during the middle of a pandemic, from $1500 a year to $4900 a year.  Needless to say, I am changing insurance providers. State Farm quoted me my original rate for the same coverage. I figure that, over the life of this new roof I am paying for, the difference in premiums would more than pay for the roof.  USAA ought to be ashamed for gouging people during these times.

This program is wonderful, it helps you reach your goal very quick and easy, I would recommend this program for anyone who is trying to get their credit score fixed</p>

USAA has the best customer service for all of their product lines. They should be your first choice if you want a representative on the phone who cares and listens. Their offerings are competitive and if you can combine products they will give you discounts on insurance policies.

USAA provides a quick and easy process when I refinanced, with a much better interest rate than my previous loan with another finance company.

Absolutely appreciate the service and features. This is my oldest credit card and will always keep this card because of USAA's service

I love usaa, their customer service is excellent and the interest rate is low despite my only having a fair score. Will absolutely to them again!

Not a fan. Would give zero stars if I could. Found a 600$ withdrawal in my acct they made.  Brought it to their attention.  They acknowledge their error but refuse to redeposit the $.  We found the error outside their 60 day window.  Great customer service?

The card has an excellent low rate for balances, however as I approach retirement, balances are not something I want to achieve, after a year they raised the 10 k to 12 and gave a cash reward card for 3.5k.

USAA has been helping my family for more than 50, maybe closer to 60 years with home and auto insurance.  And when we had a claim, they always came through and provided friendly and helpful customer service and the funds needed to help - especially with the homeowners insurance.

Terrible customer experience. Numerous problems and complaints(even formal ones with BBB). They don’t seem to get it...still. Even after contacted the CEO’s office a dozen times.  They shut down  my entire account access...twice! The first time lasted a week, then a few months later (after I was on to their broken process) it lasted for 3 days (over a weekend). Their ineffective “fraud” process kicked in and shut down my access to all my accounts without ever contacting me and asking about banking activity that was in question - not once. They make the customer squirm and try to find out what happened and get accounts access again. I closed ALL my bank accounts and annuity and moved my money to Schwab.

I’ve used USAA for a decade as my primary banking service, going with them over Navy Federal for everything I did out of loyalty and convenience at the time. After my identity was stolen and my credit fell as a result, USAA wouldn’t grand me a loan to purchase a car as a newly appointed officer. My wife and I are both active duty, both deposit all of our checks directly to USAA, and are treated terribly after an event which was not our fault. I will steer future soldiers of mine away from USAA and all clients attached to my other business who are separating from the military. They absolutely do not care about their members or their livelihood.

"USAA internet a discombobulated , disorganised confused mess." From day ONE over a SIX YEAR PERIOD trying to use the internet to conduct transactions through the internet , about every 3 months has required me to after extraordinarily long  wait times to contact USAA customer service.      Is USAA american  express run  out Mexico or what. IS ANYONE SOBER  BEHIND THE WHEEL at USAA ?  "Near non existent customer service" ,[last time I contacted USAA , I talked to 3 different agents, 3 different times having to retrieve a email security code, 1 HOUR 37 MINUTE 9 SECOND HOLD TIME . only to be told USAA is only allowed to credit your account for USAA mistakes one time a year.

I have loved USAA as they treat everyone with respect regardless of financial situation and go out of their way to assist members of USAA</p>

I have been using USAA Federal Savings Bank for many years.  At first it was great - no minimum balance for free checking; ATM rebates.  However, their service has deteriorated markedly.  There is no way to email USAA Savings Bank.  They have a poor chat interface.  And if you are unlucky enough to need to call them, good luck.    I tried to contact the bank last week after they emailed me, stating that my USAA credit card had been used on someone's Apple Pay.  I started off by calling them - once I got thru their recordings, I was told that the wait would be 2 hours and 20 minutes to talk to a representative.  You have got to be kidding me - I would not wait that long on the phone to talk to the Pope!  Next I tried their chat feature.  They were authorized to do nothing!  The representative told me I would need to call.  So I tried calling a different number.  This time they offered a feature in which they would call me back when my turn came up.  No call!  Not sure what happened to this bank in the last few years, but I would not recommend them now to my worst enemy.

Best interest rates out there! Cannot beat USAAs customer service or the benefits of being a member. Would recommend USAA to anyone eligible.

What happened USAA? I've been a member for 28 years. I had a windshield claim and was told my deductible was waived. Found out later it wasn't. Also found out it would have been $50 less expensive to go directly to the same company to get it fixed. These past two years phone hold times have significantly increased. Spending millions of dollars on NFL ads that we don't need. The military knows about you...the word has been out for decades. I'd rather see higher interest rates on my savings account than an NFL feel-good commercial. Also, thanks for selling us out to the wolves: Any investment account is now controlled by victory funds or Charles Schwab with their unending cross-selling and lack of service. So sad to see a solid company fall apart.</p>

After spending more than an hour in line at the Drive Through, car 7, I was told they don't cash in US Savings Bonds. The bank that purports itself as "patriotic" doesn't allow customers in cash in their Savings Bonds? Illogical at best.

I’m a customer of 30 years, and I hate to say this, but their banking and wire transfer service is horrible. whenever I call I get transferred around I spend a lot of time on hold and I listen to a bunch of garbage Usaa songs. Today I called and told her voice robot that I wanted wire transfers and I was on hold for 20 minutes. After that I had to give all my information to someone who then transferred me to another number that told me my wait would be 55 minutes and finally after all that hassle I had to hang up.</p>

This is a great card! Always fair and cash back rewards is great! Family members can also apply for this card since they are a part of the military family.

Fantastic financial institution that really takes care of its customers first! I've had bad experiences with other banks but not USAA. I never thought I'd say this but I have a special place in my heart for this institution.

Excellent financial institution for banking insurance investment purposes. We’ve had an ongoing relationship for many years now. maybe since back to 2008 or 2012

Amazing company to do business with. Automatically pay bills and super flexible as far as arrangements go. Customer service is always available.

Well, I just had the same experience trying to deposit my bi-weekly paycheck on the mobile app (as I do every payday). It didn't give an option to cancel the deposit after it stated it was going to hold OVER HALF of my paycheck for A WEEK. This is horrible USAA!!! I used to work for a bank. I understand the process very well, but there is no need to put a hold of that amount on a payroll check for a customer of probably 15 years. HORRIFIC business practice! Never Again!

I always have usaa at my disposal if I have questions that need to be answered. I also like the customer service that is given when I call for assistance. I am always helped in a timely manner .

The Usaa loans make it easy to prepay principal with separate entries and loan documentation and insurance all work together well if you are a member.

Payments made through the app are credited immediately.  USAA and American Express are awesome.  The only thing better is the Titanium Apple Card MasterCard through Goldman because of their system of showing how much interest you’ll pay based on the payment you’re making, and the enhanced security features, but I do love USAA!

I highly recommend USAA to all service members and veterans alike! I have enjoyed being a customer of USAA and the customer service that I have received!

I haven't had an automatic credit line increase on my credit card in about 2 yrs.  so that is why my rating is not higher. Thank you

App is by far the best I’ve ever used, 24/7 tech support, quickly resolve issues, autopay and rewards management is excellent, and little or no wait time for customer service.

They've really gone downhill over the last couple of years. When I first signed up for USAA ten years ago they were amazing. They went above and beyond any bank in the industry. Their savings rates were higher than anybody's and their customer service was top-notch. I guess they got big and did what inevitably happens to big companies - they decide they can cut corners and wring more profits. They decreased their savings and CD rates below market average, they started cutting services like free FICO scores, and now their customer service is poor as well. Pray that they don't screw up with your money because they will take no responsibility nor make any effort to correct the situation.

I got this card this card with a credit score less than 700. My score was climbing rapidly at the time, it had been less than 600 a year earlier. They gave me an automatic increase from 5500 to 7200, within a year.

They have a 7.4-year-old account that was fraud and won't take off my credit report. Then have 4 payments that bank made and they say payments weren't made and I showed them proof.

This opportunity, though a good one, no longer exists at USAA. My money is saved in a money market account. The interest I earn does not count towards the amount I can charge. Making a deposit to allow for more credit wasn't easy. USAA was kind enough to keep it open so I could get the positive effects given when an account is open 3 years or longer.</p>

Protection for members. Covid relief. Easy and fast application. Good rates for first buyers. Great customer service. Many products.

USAA did a "Charge off" on tens of thousands of accounts in December. It's a "technical glitch" according to the "specialist" I spoke to. That "technical glitch" dropped my score 20 points. I've worked very hard to get my credit rating to a very good rating and then USAA slams us with their "technical glitch". USAA, you're DISHONORABLY DISCHARGED! get out of my wallet!</p>

This is s great card we use primarily to travel to grandkids', graduations, usually fly & use for hotels that vary on availability, but not traveling during Covid.</p>

USAA will do nothing but cause all kinds of issues and steal your money. USAA IS SO NOT FOR MILITARY AT ALL. Don't even waste your time going to USAA. Especially auto insurance.</p>

When in need the USAA team found ways to assist without hesitation, I am extremely happy to recommend USAA. My needs are always in the forefront of their services.

I paid 1500 down on my card and then they lowered my limit by 1000. I would not recommend a USAA credit card to anyone. Now my credit utilization is sky high.

Simple 1.5% cash back on everything. I just wish it had a welcome bonus or 2% cash back on everything. If you’re looking for a no frills card. This is it.

The best and most professional financial and insurance company that services our soldiers and veterans  A first rate company. Always happy with their outstanding service

USAA visa card is not listed - Ive had the card for over ten yrs. and I havent missed a payment Now the card is paid off completely

Love this app and it helps with knowing my credit before the creditors! If you're looking for an application that can truly assist you in monitoring and maintaining good I mean a good credit score this is it.

The card will never be a regular card. Always secured. With a annual fee. The intetest rate is very high. Customer service is not very good

If you have a problem the auto insurance entity they will deny you access to you to your banking if the folks on the auto insurance side dem it so so you cannot manage your money especially since they are an online bank that is suppose to cater to veterans yet their practice is punitive.  You get in one too many car accident or any other car insurance issue they act like they are the military and punish your banking. cant log on view accounts pay bills or anything. This practice should be illegal.

I used to be a major fan of USAA but their claims process needs to be reviewed and revamped.  I had 2 auto claims which required numerous phone calls from me to find out the status of my claims and to receive funds that I were supposed to receive within in a certain time frame.  On one claim, no one approved the amount I was supposed to receive for a totaled vehicle and there was no reason why it was missed.  On the other claim, someone elected to mail a reimbursement check to me instead of just doing an EFT transaction.  EFT = 24-48 hours, mailed check = Its been  9 days and counting...  The postal service has nothing to do with this company, but once again I had to call (2 days ago) and ask for my funds to be transferred instead of waiting for a check.  Still no funds.   When I called and spoke to a representative today, I was told me the check had to be voided BEFORE an EFT could be sent to my bank account, and that had to be done first.  ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!?!  This is so baffling to me, I don't get this.  I was fan, but now I am not.  The people are nice and they are courteous, but they also need to be trained properly and/or their computer programs updated so people are prompted with reminders for certain transactions, cause no offense, being nice isnt going to help me meet my financial obligations and responsibilities.

horrible bank and horrible customer service. I had an issue with them back when I was in the army, I needed to talk to a customer service representatives, so I get connected to one and explain the problem. without getting into the details of the story, basically the customer service employee didn't know how to help me or didn't even try. He pretended that he is working on the problem and he put me on hold, as I was on hold for more than 10 minutes I get back on the phone, and its a whole different customer service rep. I was so confused and even the other rep was confused, so I thought okay maybe that was just a mistake. So I had to explain my story all over again to the new rep, AGAIN they put me on hold for even longer. And I kid you not, you cant make these things up, the second rep does the same thing to me. At this point I am just in disbelief, like this can't be right, super unprofessional and childish. So again I explained my problem for the 3rd time and of course no help, and they said they will call me back. Of course, never got a call back. Fast forward a few weeks, decided to take all the money I had in my savings and checking out of the accounts. Left about 50 dollars in there, I called and closed the accounts and they informed me they will mail me my remaining balance in the mail as a check. I was like okay cool, I get the check 6 months later. DO NOT BANK WITH THIS INSTITUTION</p>

Excellent customer service; very professional and knowledgeable!  Always answers any/all questions and goes 10 extra miles if necessary to ensure satisfactory results and with a smile; extremely pleasant with a "can-do" attitude and a friendliness manner that leaves you feeling as if you are the only concern they have!  Love this business; would highly recommend them to anyone seeking their services. They truly are wonderful in every regard!

They are great but need better customer service because of the pandemic.  Phone call are not being return on a timely manners.  The interest are still high.  I will be moving on to another lender because their interest are still high.

Good card. Nice color card too. It looks fancy. It pays my bills. I get cash back when I use it. If I pay my bill on time, I don’t pay interest.

I haven't had any issues with this card. It has helped me build my credit over the years and has the lowest interest rate of any of my cards

They are very petty! They made we wait for a check to clear to post the payment to my account! Which caused me a late pay and they refuse to remove it

I like that USAA is not for just the General's.  They opened it up to could any person  who served in the Military.  Also have there own shopping discounts thru other stores along with discounts on travel, cars, homes.

I have been a member in good standing of USAA Federal Savings Bank for over forty -five years. I have my vehicle insured with USAA. I have a Checking account with USAA and I have a low interest VISA Credit card with USAA.

Really total crap. They charge way too much and kill your wallet. Screw them. When I'm rich after i create my video game they can suck it.

Great card for Veterans and Active Duty Military. When the pandemic began USAA was the first to offer it’s members lower premiums and temporary suspension of payments

This card came in handy when I had major repairs.  My only disappointment with a credit card my Credit score fluctuates as my balance rises.

Fair and helpful customer service. Credit card usage alerts available. Raised my credit limit well beyond my expectations within the first year.

Simple to use.  Never any issues.  They protect you for fraudulent charges by contacting you as soon as they see out of the ordinary charges.

Security and service, along with 1.5% cash back on purchases, are the main reasons I rely on my USAA Visa card. I have been a loyal customer for over 50 years.

This card has worked great for me and my family. I really like how it helps me to have access to my account when ever I’m ready to conduct a transaction. ??

Usaa hurt my credit score over $10 that I lost track of because I don`t use my card regularly. Instead of calling me and letting me know I owed them they hurt my score by putting it past due. Wow!!!!</p>

This account is closed by myself.  Because it was a secured credit card and USAA no longer supports a Secured credit card program.

Great business to associate with, the customer service is above reproach.  The services offered are very helpful as well as product.

I use USAA for my credit cards, insurance policies, and banking. The more you use USAA, the more you save with them. Bundling is a great way to save and this is a great company to bundle with. I've been overall very happy with USAA's customer service. You may have to wait on the phone for a bit (generally a half hour or less) to get through to someone, but once you do they are extremely helpful. I would definitely recommend USAA to a friend.

Great card when used properly.  It was a credit line with a family member. No longer in use.  If giving the opportunity to open it again.  I'll take it

Usaa has a great fraud protection system.  There interste rate is also the lowest aorund. Thye have a great reward system and atm reimbursement.

I've been a customer at USAA for over 10 years. I've had checking accounts, several savings accounts, auto and home insurance. Recently some random person tried to pay a USAA credit card using one of my savings accounts. This savings account hadn't been used in many years. I should have closed the account considering there was maybe only 5 cents in the account. Their debt collection representative called me and accused me of over drafting this account. I tried to explain that I do not have nor have I EVER had a USAA credit card. I had to speak to 3 different reps and verify a multitude of information just to explain my side. They were trying to tell me that 7 years after my divorce that the secondary on my savings account (my ex husband) had made the payment. They refused to listen to me that I didn't have any payments or any accounts connected to this savings account. I expressed many times that there had to be fraud on the account because my ex didn't even know nor did he care about this savings account with 5 cents worth inside. The reps still insisted he must have made the payment. I don't know how the hell that would be possible nor why they would be so rude to me. I spent hours of my time being handed around to different departments to which all of them refused to accept that this was fraudulent Activity. No one could tell me who the credit card belonged to nor could they explain to me how that person was able to use this account to pay a credit card without verifying the account. I'm extremely disappointed in this company. How can they be designed for active military and veterans while actively screwing us over. I have never been in any kind of bad standing with this company. I've never even had a late payment on any of my policies. I felt so disrespected. I will never recommend nor use USAA for anything as long as I live.

They always give outstanding customer service, and their rates are great.  I have had no negative experiences whatsoever with USAA

USAA is a wonderful bank. Credit card, employees are fantastic. I can say that I am very pleased with my experiences with USAA and would highly recommend them.

Unethical bank USAA The worst bank to work for as well as use. This bank is lead by directors that have no clue to what their doing! The only concern they have daily is where to eat and who not to promote. I've been asked to break ethic codes and violate credit card procedures with testing their upgrades to the mobile app. And when refused I was eventually fired. Even after reporting the violations through the proper channels. The only mission directors have is take care of your own friends. Its no wonder this bank was fined tremendously last year and continue to go through audits.

I love this card & the bank/ its great and they always contact you when things do not look right./The only problem, just ant type problem, is nothing to worry about.

USAA is one of my most trusted credit providers which I trust. While there may be cheaper rates on some cards, they seem to have some good benefits with their program.</p>

Always quick to respond to any questions I may have and very thorough in response as far as direct contact with any merchant or business.

It has no rewards. The interest rates are high. But the customer service is nice to deal with. The balance transfers are easy to make.

Awesome bank and card. Been w them over 10 years. The secured part is held in a CD so it's getting interest. Great way to build beginning credit!

I'm leaving usaa after 27 years because they donate to planned parenthood through the United way,it's a real shame,and I talked to the CEO office,and they didn't care if I left them or not,they made me feel unappreciated?

Excellent credit card with great customer service! Credit line is good and interest rate is fair. Easy to contact. Resolve complications quickly. Definitely customer oriented.

USAA made the experience easy and hassle free to recieve the loan money and to repay through their app! Would recommend! Too bad they no longer offer the CD loans I was using!

I do not recommend this bank any longer.  I have been with them for well over 10 years.  Two years ago we bought a house and needed to give a check to basically hold the house.  For some reasons, the "people" that were selling the house, decided to keep the check for 2 years and then decide to cash it, in the middle of a pandemic where a lot of people have lost jobs, including my husband.  So what was left in the bank was already spoken for.  Well, despite having a three month "expiration" date for checks, wonderful USAA decides to cash the check and will not help to get the money back.  I even called the other bank and the other bank was willing to help, but since USAA refuses to help, we are now out money for our mortgage.  Thanks a lot USAA, I can really tell how much you value your long standing customers.  Why even bother having an "expiration" date for checks if you don't honor it?  I've had other issues with this sorry bank before, but this one takes the cake, and I will be looking for another bank, I suggest you do the same too.

USAA has been there through the thick and thin. They really have come through when we really needed it. Even with the little credit I have with them. Also being veteran has helped also

USAA is one of the best and most through financial companies I have ever used. I would recommend anyone that can qualify to use them as well.

Had it for years and it’s provided everything I’m looking.  Never a single issue with either the card or USAA. Would 100% recommend

I love this bank, frictionless transactions every time.  Very upfront and friendly customer service.  Couldn’t beat a boat loan rate with a local credit union, but otherwise great rate on auto.  Very competitive and high limit credit card with intro APR was a nice bonus.  Very digital company makes everything silky smooth.

Excellent bank.  They back it up with impeccable service.  I have been a longtime member and appreciate all those who serve veterans.

This is hands down the best credit card I’ve ever had. Low interest, no annual fees, & exceptional service. It’s also been very helpful in allowing me to skip minimum payments when I’ve paid more than the min due for a particular month.

Excellent service!!! Absolutely love this financial institution. USAA answers all concerns promptly and professionally! They immediately inform you of any suspicious activities!

They got us away from Santander and saved over 16% interest.  I have previously financed two other vehicles w USAA and a home. Their online service and operators you speak to are awesome!

Love USAA.  Banked with them over 50 years. Always helpful and an email or phone call away. Have insurance for home and cars, savings, checking account, and stock portfolio with them

I love USAA because they are always there to help and as a veteran, I appreciate their respect. Their customer service is outstanding.

Great institution! They gave me a chance, when nobody else would. I was turned down for a Capital One secured card, but USAA offered me a rewards credit card, and with 3 months of on time payments my credit has improved 100 points.

Regarding my USAA, This account is paid off on June 27 2020 & at this time it has 0 balance ,please check for accuracy ,I hope it gets reported ASAP

Gray card great bank great experience and the best overall bank I have ever been with.  I feel blessed to have had them help me get back on track.  USAA IS THE BEST barnone!

Always a breeze working with USAA for my auto loans. Have used only them for each car I've bought for the last 10 years. It's so nice to go into a dealership knowing your financing is already done.

Love getting cash back. I always apply it to my existing balance. It is nice to have to pay a lower bill each time I apply the cash credit to my balance.  I have been a USAA member for over 50 years!

Honestly I love this card because of the monthly payback fee is super low like 15 dollars per month low. I prefer this cc over Capital One's credit card whose apr is over 18 percent and it's montly fee is usually 100 dollars. Capital One honestly did not at all did not show any remorse when it came down to Covid-19. Capitalone stopped monthly bill for a whole month. My husband would had to call Capitalone and please request an extension for each month at a time. Unlike USAA they extended the card payment over 3 months.  One con I noticed too, do not reach over 30 percent then this card would decrease credit score until customer pays on the card.

My experience has been very positive with all services and with the outstanding customer service as well. Thank you for being so efficient and professional.

My parents introduced me to my first USAA account and card. In a veteran family and the moving and travel associated with it, a solid bank and maintaining excellent credit scores is a key to financial success.  My Dad told me USAA has always been there for us and I will continue trusting in USAA.

I’ve only had one issue where I lost my card. It was taken care of right away and only took two days for my replacement card to get to me. Overall I like it.

Very good monitoring good on updates . make sure i understand clearly what going on with all my accounts even the ones thats close d

The car buying and loan process was pretty smooth sailing.  All of it was done online with precision and ease.  This has by far has been the best experience I have had purchasing a car.

I got this to build credit initially. I was told that I could update to a non secured card in future but that was not true. The USAA CC I have was discontinued and they would not allow me to upgrade my card for some reason even though I’ve never had an issue.

USAA financial and insurance services are bar none the best in the US.    I exclusively use USAA for banking needs including Credit Cards, Debit Cards

Excellent bank, strict credit standards for all loans and credit services. Insurance rates and premiums are consider the best in the market.

Purchases are often rejected for no reason.  Also usage in foreign travel is also often a problem even when we have submitted a travel iternary.

It is an amazing card if they would keep posting the stores you get maximum rewards to take care of the advantages this show and ear higher rewards

Don't ever dispute with these people because they don't help you at all They listen to the merchant they don't even look at the contract nothing

I received this card as secured and like the fact that you can make payments and it is reflected right away and you can block usage.

Usaa is the worst bank . They have zero fraud protection . My card was used over 7 times . With fraudulent purchases . Usaa is the worst . I bank with capital one now . They haven’t gave me the worst fraud protection

Great company that has helped me as much as possible, which is saying alot for a financial company. Thank God my grandpa kicked ass in the navy during WW2

Excellent customer service experiences, outstanding location and very feasible for during weekend bank deposits and services, #awesome

Great account! Reports often and accurate reflection of my balance. Also helps credit score to have a card like this on file, that reports often.

Why would anyone say USAA is a good bank? Because they weren’t members long enough to get screwed over and treated dirty by them. We have accounts all in good standing and USAA inexplicably put a TEN day hold on our paycheck. After two phone calls, one rep was completely unhelpful saying there was nothing she could do and claimed it was the system. The second rep signed us up for their relief fund and said she couldn’t get ahold of a senior rep, left a message and would speak to her manager to get the hold lifted by the next day. The hold was finally lifted a week later! We had to move money to cover bills and anything left over is getting moved out. We will not take the risk of this happening again!

Was non stressful buying the home; USAA took care of most everything.  Down side is the fees were a bit high; considering what will actually be paid for the home in 30 years, due to interest. .

Best card ever! I Can pay from my account. I get warnings when payment is upcoming and the company is green with paper waste. I love this card.

They alway take care of any situation extremely fast, answer all question and are extremely helpful. I would not use any other card

USAA is the best bank to get anything you need. Even insurance!!! Do not hesitate to give these folks a call for any of your banking or insurance needs.

Low interest rate. Very helpful when you have questions. Only problem hard credit check for card increase . I will always keep this card

USAA is a great bank.  I have had credit problems and they didn’t even hesitate to approve me.  They are always nice, patient and look to save me money.  Just got 30% of my car insurance payment back for 3 months during coronavirus due to less driving from members.

It's just a basic no rewards secured card from USAA. Nothing to complain about.  Worked everytime I needed it. There are annual fees.  Helps build credit.

I got this loan when I was trying to get a brand new 2019 Camaro and I was only approved for 95% of it. I took out this installment loan so that I can still get the car. Not a smart move but USAA has been fantastic through the years and continue to do so.

This is another credit card, that has gotten me out of trouble. The longer I’ve had the account the more they’ve raised my credit limit which is both a blessing and a curse. Because I tend to be a thrift spend. But I’m working on becoming debt-free and I will keep this card in the future.

This is the first card I got as a secured card after a financial crash, and they've definitely earned my business. They're been great to deal with. The "interest bearing account" is kind of a joke, I've earned like $20 in interest in 5 YEARS! The ONLY thing that REALLY ticks me off is that there's no option to turn it to an unsecured card! Not 1 late payment or just minimum payment in 5 years, plus my score is at least 200 points higher than when I got the card, yet no option to unsecure it.

I pay my business mobile service once a month with this card. The only reason I keep this card is because its the oldest credit card I have. There are no rewards with this card.

Great card. Highly recommend this card to anyone looking to build credit and a relationship with a good banking institution. I intend to move all my banking tonUSAA

USAA Credit Card through USAA has always been highly rated by me, and I definitely recommend this credit union for every veteran or active duty military person!

Overall Excellent Resource as well as Service. Through Company if you have problems - just keep them informed and they will work with you.

This bank issued credit to an individual who used my identity. Apparently it approved credit for about 20k. I found out once I tried to apply for a car loan. The fraudster used the extended credit to it's max along with other 35k of other credit also part of this scam. I was able to clean my credit from all the banks except this usaa bank. I am trying my best, and have gone through so much time send trouble and still have not been able to succeed with this usaa bank. Will eventually sue in a small claim court, but I would suggest checking your credit file frequently to avoid been a victim like myself.

USAA Banking Credit Card is simply put: AWESOME!!! They will alert you when unusual activities occur on your account and quickly correct and/or the issues!!! Thanks for ALL i do!!!

Always appreciate USSA customer service.  Their website is pretty nice also.  Good information and friendly personnel who treat you with respect.

I've had this card for many years.  I've always had a great relationship with USAA.  I have recommended them to all of my children.

USAA MEMBER for over 30 years!  Great products, great insurance, great banking!  They set the standard for all to follow! Highly Recommended!

Have been a USAA member for over 30 years and have never had a complaint about any of their products!!  If you’re eligible and not a member, you should be!

USAA don’t follow up with disputes in a timely manner and they want the customer to the the majority of the work. Once you file the dispute USAA IS NOT Consumer friendly

USAA car loan was paid in full in March 2020, there is a zero balance, all my payment were made on time each month, never had a late payment

USAA Military Affiliate Card is a excellent credit card. The card company has excellent customer service representative that care about their card holders.

USAA makes it so easy! Didn’t have to do a bunch of extra paperwork. I was able to do everything through the app. When I set up automatic payments it decreased my APR.

Easy to get a loan, easy monthly payments, a great bank.  I have car and renter's insurance, along with a Visa card.  This bank is a godsend for us Veterans and familys.

No rewards after intro rewards so after you get the intro it’s just like any other card. Kinda pointless to have if there’s no rewards. I have it for credit limit balance to ratio only

At one time USAA was an awesome place to bank. I was a dedicated customer for years. In recent years their customer service has deteriorated so badly that I moved all of my accounts elsewhere. I recently received a special offer for a credit card through USAA and thought I would try them out again to see if they have figured out their business. Well nothing has changed. Ridiculous policies that keep you in the dark about your account. Off the wall accounting practices from the previous century. Have not been able to find one employee that knows anything about their business. Totally clueless. Too many great choices out there for banking. I won't waste anymore time with the frustration that USAA puts their customers through.

Thanks USAA BANK CAR LOAN, for trying to assist with our current financial situation. We are grateful that you are able to accommodate us at this time.

They have always treated me with respect . They have a great selection of ways to save money and savings options to save money. Any time I have a question I call and get service and an answer with Great customer service.

Great card, excellence limits. Good for veterans with new or credit restoration. I got approved for $2000 with a credit score of 635. I opened a saving and checking account with USAA. I estimate that I could get a credit limit increase by December and have a total credit limit of about $5000. Kudos to USAA

I enjoy using this app because it’s pretty accurate in comparison to other websites I’ve tried in the past.  I do recommend getting this app!

I bought my first car with USAA, I had a decent 2 plus year credit history with a score of 740-770. I didn't know what to expect, but I spoke with multiple people multiple times and they were always very welcoming and eager to help and explain things. In the end I got what I thought was an amazing 4.59APR for my age (22yrs old) I bought myself the car of my dreams(2016 Dodge charger, only an SXT but we all got to start somewhere!) at the age of 22. Thanks to USAA I got a sweet APR and some of the best and most affordable automotive insurance available.

Love everything usaa amazing company and customer service. Wouldn't go anywhere else. They go above and beyond to help those who bank with them.

Just a veteran, but good enough!  I had some unexpected major expenses three years ago.  Good credit score, security clearance. Just drowning in high interest.  Tried getting loans with credit unions in my area who make their fortunes from vets with clearances.  They either turned me down or did a bait and switch on the interest rate due to my high D/I  ratio.  I even applied with online lenders who guarantee the lowest rates.  But it was USAA that came thru for me in the end.  I guess I should have known, as I've been very happy with their bar none customer service since day one.  I'll be looking to refinance my primary residence and rental property soon.  USAA won't have the lowest rate, I'm sure.  But they'll be the first Bank I call.  Trust me when I say, it's important to have a good relationship with your lender.

If you qualify,  USAA is the very best in insurance, banking, credit card and customer service.  Investment products are also offered but I use & am happy with Fidelity (advanced capabilities for active traders)

I had been with USAA for 20 years. Had my checking, savings, auto and renters insurance and 2 credit cards with them. I work in the service industry and make a good portion of my income in cash tips. For 4 years I’ve been consistently making deposits by buying money orders because they do not have any other way for me to deposit cash in Arizona. One day I received a phone call from a USAA employee asking me all kinds of questions about why I deposit money orders and where is my cash coming from, etc. she was extremely rude, I felt like she was treating me like I had done something wrong and I was a criminal being interrogated. It was so intrusive, rude and offensive. I asked her why she is asking these questions and she snapped at me and said “because it’s my job!” I was really in disbelief that I was really being treated this way by a  bank that I had been with for half my life! Mind you, I was only depositing about $6,000 per month in money orders. After asking more questions, she was basically accusing me of money laundering! Unbelievable! At this point I was being offended and told her I’m not interested in speaking with her until she can talk to me with the respect that i deserve. I knew upon hanging up she would flag my account somehow. I didn’t hear back so I assumed she never did figure out how to talk respectfully. 4 months later, I was accepted for an Amex Card thru USAA with a $20,000 limit. I already had a visa and used both cards monthly but never kept a balance because I would always pay if the bills every month and always on time. About 2 later, now 6 months after being treated like a criminal, my auto insurance increased by $50 per month for no apparent reason, I didn’t get any tickets or have any accidents but a couple days after I noticed the increase I received a letter in the mail from USAA stating “they are exercising their right to no longer do business with me and after 2 weeks from the date Of the letter all my accounts except my insurance will be closed, so they suggested I make other arrangements if I had any plans of funds to be taken from any of my accounts. I was in shock! I don’t know what happened to USAA but they have completely changed over the last few years with how they treat their customers. I’m so glad I didn’t have my retirement account with them! The way I was treated is absolutely absurd! USAA has become nothing more than an immoral company with no class and no funks to give about their customers. At the end of the day I’m relieved to no longer support such a terrible, cold hearted business and have been treated like gold over at Bank of America! USAA can go kick rocks, I encourage anyone and everyone who is considering becoming a customer of USAA to not walk, but run away from this place! And never look back! And the folks that are still with them, you should really reevaluate and consider going with a better institution, one that will treat ours customers with respect and appreciation! And at the very minimum, have a back up plan should they decide they would like to exercise their right to no longer do business with you, too!

Excellent service, always there to help if needed either via a live chat or email. No service fees for transactions overseas or using any ATM since the Bank would refund the fees charged by other Banks.

The USAA Card is our “go to” in case of an emergency. It gets used very rarely and gets paid off when it is used. We will probably keep it around until USAA offers another 0% transfer fee and then cancel it after that

USAA with low rate is the best card I had ever had in a long, long time. I would them a big thumbs up and love my car insurance. So glad to be a card holder and a USAA member.

No better no worse than any other credit card. Nothing special but a nice addition to the USAA family of financial tools. If you pay significantly over the minimum, after a couple of months, they give you a “break” from a payment

I've been with USAA for several years. I have my house and car insurance with them. No problems so far. If I have a question all I need to do is call them or email or online chat with them and the will take care of the problem.

I think this  is a good card if you use it wisely. Interest is about the same as all cards. I have gone over my limit but I paid the overage before I was charged for it.

I use this card daily and it's been a great convenience. USAA rocks and always a positive experience with customer service. I'm a customer for life. Good stuff!

No complaints. Have had the card since 2011 and they’ve been great! It was the first CC I ever got! They have always been extremely helpful and nice when I’ve had questions or issues have arised.

I recently switched to this card from a travel card that charged me annual fee and I am getting to old to do much travel. This card charges me no fees,  provides cash rewards and I it use instead of carrying cash for my purchases. I have been with USAA since 1960 and never had a problem with their services.

Great bank and great credit card, love doing business with USAA. Would recommend this card to anyone looking to get a credit card.

Definitely not the best but it is easy there is always help close by and within reach is a really great feeling and impressionable theres a few things they could fix with menu options and easier pathways to get what you need

USAA has been my insurance and banking source for the past 45 years. I would recommend it to anyone who seeks reliable financial services at more than competitive rates.

Exceeded my expectations at every level. I’m proud to be part of the USAA family. I also have my automobile and homeowners policy through USAA.

Loan accomplished online and finalized in minutes. Having my auto insurance with USAA meant that I drove off the lot fully insured immediately, too! Great Experience.

Outstanding. Love the card. Would highly recommend it. Just remember to keep your utilization between 3-5 percent. Great card to have in your arsenal.

I made a mistake once and took a car loan from a different bank. USAA Always has the best rates. Never feels like they’re trying to just make money out of you like other banks.

excellent company to do business with, I have been a customer for 41 years having financed cars,boats,rvs , and insurance products.

You cannot graduate from this card. It’s a complete waiste of your time and effort. Find another secured card to use such as discover, capital one or navy federal.

So you can get a good night's sleep and I will talk to you later I love you too baby girl and I will be there in the morning to see if you have

It was the most difficult task My wife and I have ever encountered. I’d been a USAA member for over 50 years. We had over $2.5 million in in 8 mutual funds and several savings accounts. We did not have to borrow a dime, but wanted to borrow half of the cost for tax advantages. Our combined income at that time was $240,000.  We provided ever document the first manager required and 3 weeks later he was promoted and moved to another position. The next manager was in Arizona rather than Texas. Apparently she didn’t or couldn’t find all the former previously provided documents. Later she located them after we’d again sent them. I won’t say more except she was difficult to understand.  The entire experience was pure hell. I will never use USAA again for a morgage.

They are Great and reliable helped me with the car buying process . I recommend to everyone that can get them . I have them for my insurance s d home mortgages too

I will use this card to help me improve on getting my credit score higher because I am looking to purchase my first home and with a higher credit score and better spending habits it help with me achieving my goals.

I bank with USAA have experienced hardship lately bk discharged in nov in dec USAA handed over my account over to collection agency without ever contacting me hopefully with their reviews they can clear this matter up!

Too high and I should have used someone else for the loan. Called USAA and could not even explain how the rate was chosen. Disappointed

USAA is amazing I am so glad I was in the military. They are very helpful all my questions are answered in a timely fashion.  All interactions with USAA are positive.

Responsive customer service, easy to keep on top of things with USAA app. Rates are reasonable if your credit is in good standing. Decent cashback reward rate.

Great card available to a exclusive club of military veterans you get to pick your design from what branch of service you served in no bull crap just straight rewards for usage.

Great bank to do business with , I would definitely recommend them . Super nice courteous and friendly willing to go the extra mile .

USAA was respectful and treated me like they wanted my business. They treated me like I was a person, not a number. When I made a mistake when filling out the dealer paperwork USAA stepped in and worked directly with the dealer instead of making me go back and forth between the two. All I had to do was sign the correct paperwork. Kudos to USAA!

Was able to refi for a lower rate over the phone with customer service. USAA customer service is probably the best in the banking industry that I have experienced.

The USAA auto loan process is user friendly, and efficient. Having a pre-approved loan before you contact a dealership makes the buying process much more smooth.

It was my first credit card and the experience has been great. The APR is low compared to what I see around and USAA as a bank and even insurance provider is top notch.

I have nothing special to say about this card. I have had a good experience with USSA. This review requires 130 characters to submit. Really?

Simple and easy to navigate. Great customer service. I like how organized everything is and the information provided on each account.

We had a terrible experience with USSA online bank. The app they gave us was on a Pilot (beta) version of their app. It did not function fully and they refused to put us in the fully functional app. It was terrible to be a second class customer. We also had an impossible time getting a simple form signed to process our pension check to their bank. We are in the process of closing our account. They are a huge dissappointment.

Love the card and what it has done for my credit score..thus ya the best card you can get while trying to rebuild your credit. Go get it!

From start to finish usaa staff has been very helpful and kept me up to date with everything I needed and needed to do. I did everything online through the usaa app and it was quick and easy updating and uploading my data. I have nothing but good things to say about this process and I hope the rest of my experience with usaa goes great.

awsome bank, would recommend to anyone needing a loan. They are there to help you if you are in need of help. Always very nice when talking to you.

I have belonged to USAA for over 30 years. They always have great customer service, rates, and products.  I plan of remaining with them for many years.

Excellent customer service. Helpful, courteous and willing to go the extra mile to assist with questions.  Our family has been USAA members for over 50 years!

Great card for working on your credit. Make your payments and keep the balance under 10% for the best credit results. Also make sure not to close this account as it could reflect in a negative way.

Great customer service and high initial credit limit. USAA ATM's are finally popping up like weeds in my city. At first there were way too few. There aren't any brick and mortar buildings outside of Texas, but they do have strategically placed USAA ATM's, user friendly mobile app and excellent 24 hour customer service. Unfortunately according to USAA employee, you are stuck with interest rate that you were approved for and can't ever get it lowered even if your credit score increases. That needs to be addressed and changed!

I would highly recommend an auto loan with usaa. Very friendly, courteous and helpful. I've been a customer for 6-7 years. I can't even complain about usaa.

Very professional staff and made the loan process quick and seamless. Completed the process in 30 minutes or less. I would recommend them to anyone

Great company to work with. The agents are great and always willing to help meet your needs. Excellent customer service and excellent rates. Would highly recommend USAA for insurance and banking needs .

Very easy process.  Was able to do almost the entire process online with a quick detail confirmation call at the end.  Very friendly and helpful the entire process.

This is a Five-Star card that saves me and my family money every day. My husband and I use 4 cards from USAA, 2 each, my son also uses a USAA card and I highly recommend this card to others as it offers the lowest interest rate of all my cards. Save money with USAA!!!

Best insurance and Banking Company ever a great benefit for serving or being the dependent of someone who served our country.           Mm

This CC is disappointing. We’ve had it for over 50 years however it has changed names  four times and each time the age begins anew. Also after many many years it switched from Master Card to VISA. You guessed it, The time reverted to zero.

The only reason I'm giving it 4 star because they dont report the balance on real time for the car loans. they tend to wait once ever 2 month. Then update your balance. My debt ratio is far lower than what's being reported.

They made buy so easy from start to finish the app is great very easy to use also there warranties are much better value than dealership

Excellent bank to establish and build your family credit. All your banking needs from insurance to retirement. Excellent service and always friendly!!

USAA has been excellent in all aspects of my financial banking and insurance needs. The USAA credit card has also been a very useful tool over the years.

I love USAA Bank. The interest rate is great but they do want to hold monies! I make a payment and it doesn’t hit my card as paid for at least 5 days?

Usaa is a great company to do business with. They are always very pleasant and willing to help you out with any problems that you may have

This is a great card to get started on your credit journey. I received this card when I was 18 and never really knew much about credit and how things work. This is a very basic card with decent rewards. 2x on gas and restaraunts

Great bank, ease of  operation , do all my banking through usaa and would highly recommend usaa to all military persons whether active or not.

So far seems just OK. NFCU now also offers an additional $200 refi bonus ! Didn't get that at USAA !!! If I would have known I just would have done it @NFCU where I have mostly all of my current accounts. But USAA is still just OK...!! They don't seem to update the current loan balance total monthly either ? What's up with that ? Also their insurance quote's (home and auto) were considerably higher than my current insurance company ?

USAA presents itself as a banking organization that helps its Veteran members. I sold my car because I had to move for work reasons and deposited my check, several thousand dollars, into my USAA checking account through their mobile phone app’s deposit feature. After the deposit was submitted I received a notice that only 10% of the funds would be available and that the rest will be held for 7 days, which is longer than it actually takes for the check to clear. The app never gave me a choice to back out, it simply said that my money was being held, so I could not move. I spoke with their executive resolution team and they were resolutely obstinate in denying the timely release of my funds, citing internal bank policies. IF YOU ARE A VETERAN USAA WILL SCREW YOU JUST THE SAME AS ANY OTHER BANK, except without local offices or tellers unless you happen to live close to them. I understand having to protect your deposits but holding peoples’ money hostage for far longer than it actually takes for a check to clear the fed is unreasonable and unconscionable...this is people’s lives!! Keep this in mind before you choose to do distance banking with USAA, when it comes to helping veterans, their internal rules are just as inflexible and you will have nowhere to go.

I got this card primarily so I could get 5% cash back on base purchases.  I have been using for several months and just looked up my rewards.  Firstly, the website makes it incredibly confusing to get an accurate look at what your rewards percentage actually is for each individual purchase.  For example, my wife's duplicate card is only showing 1% cash rewards for everything.  Over the phone with USAA, I was told that duplicate cards always show only 1% on the card reward details webpage, but it adds another 4% into your total rewards.  It may be true, but the only way for me to actually verify that is to look at the total rewards and subtract the rewards amount from my card and then do some more math - well it is unnecessarily difficult to say the least.  It blows my mind in 2019 that they can't get their website to simply show the exact percentage and amount of cash rewards earned on each purchase.  My other credit cards seem to do that without difficulty.  So I also noticed that while I am getting 5% on gas purchases on my card, I am only getting 1% on all my base purchases, mostly Navy Exchanges (different ones in different states).  I asked USAA to clarify this as well.  Was the other 4% magically showing up somewhere else, in a way that I couldn't track it, like my wife's rewards supposedly were?  No.  After they put me on hold for 5 minutes they came back and confirmed that all my on base purchases were only earning me 1%.  They blamed the Navy Exchange for coding their stores as "general merchandise" instead of "military" or something like that.  It seems that USAA should probably look at those codes before promising 5% cash back on all on base purchases.  In conclusion, this card is useful only for earning 5% cash back on gas, at least for me and also possibly (still not really sure) for my wife's card.  Since you almost certainly have another card that can beat the 1% for on base purchases, then the card is really not useful for that purpose.  Perhaps you live on a base where all the military stores code the way that USAA thinks they should, and you will earn the advertised 5%.  Good luck trying to figure that out in advance.  With the combination of much lower than expected rewards and a website that is confusing as hell when trying to track your rewards, I regret that I ever got this card.  For now I'll keep it in my wallet and use it for gas only, but if I can find another card that comes close on gas then I'll probably throw it permanently in the same drawer as my other USAA credit card.  They do banking well but I am 0 for 2 on USAA credit cards.  Never again.

I would select ZERO STARS if I could.  The worst credit card offer scam I ever fell for - my bad.  I signed up for a good offer from USAA that was in reality too good to be true.  The offer was for an extra 15,000 rewards points if I spent $500 in the first 3 months.  I did that.  Never got the credit.  I called and was told it would be resolved within 1 - 2 billing cycles.  I waited.  Nothing.  I called back, sorry sir, we have no record of you signing up for that offer.  I called back again.  They then responded that my application (submitted weeks before the deadline) had to be approved before 12/31/18.  Mine was not approved until 1/3/19.  Apparently they can take as long as they like and I have no recourse.  Card is now shredded.  Account closed.

I do NOT recommend that anyone get the USAA Cashback Rewards Plus AMEX if they want to get the 5% back on base purchases. I made several transactions at the Navy Exchange, which should code according to the card&#x2019;s rewards terms and conditions as a base purchase.  "Qualifying Purchases on Military Bases" are Qualifying Purchases made at businesses that are included in a merchant category identified as primarily selling goods and/or services on United States military bases (such as commissaries, exchanges and shoppettes).  These transactions, however, coded as 1 cent per dollar cash back. When I called USAA to inquire I was told that it is up to the individual Exchange on how they code the transaction based on items I purchase. He said I could get back anywhere from 1 cent, 2 cents, 3 cents, etc. depending on what I buy. I bought some baby supplies and clothing, but apparently these items didn&#x2019;t qualify. I&#x2019;ve heard of merchants coding incorrectly, but this excuse of individual items coding incorrectly does not sound right.  I read that these base merchants (Exchanges, Commissaries, Gas Stations) no longer code as &#x201c;Government Service&#x201d; but now as "General Merchandise," which will not trigger the 5%. Ultimately if this is true, then this card is now promoted on the basis of false advertisement.  It&#x2019;s ridiculous that USAA won&#x2019;t honor their 5% category, which was the main sticking point in getting this card and that I have to hope for the 5%, which apparently is unlikely. Beyond telling me it&#x2019;s up to the merchant, they did nothing to rectify the problem.  I don&#x2019;t use it for gas since I live right next to a Costco which has vastly cheaper prices than base, but doesn&#x2019;t accept AMEX, so I use my Costco Anywhere VISA that earns 4% back.

I have had the unpleasant opportunity (?) to deal with departments throughout the USAA organization, given my 30+ years as a member.  Overall, there is a &#x201c;who cares&#x201d; and &#x201c;not my department or problem&#x201d; attitude from many representatives.   Here are my recent (last 5 years or so) experiences:  1)  A nonaccountability problem: Examples:  Prior to the purchase of a home, with a corresponding need to access cash from USAA for that purchase, I was misinformed by not one but two representatives at USAA that the funds could be accessed without problem or delay when needed. My husband, an attorney, questioned the USAA policy, hence my second call to USAA to confirm what I was initially told.  When following the advice of the two USAA reps the day before closing on the house, I was told by a third rep that I had been misinformed by TWO reps, and now, under the gun, we had to scramble (letters, faxes, signatures) to access the funds (it was now 10:30 at night).  During a subsequent phone conversation with yet another USAA rep, she blamed my lawyer husband for not understanding what needed to be done.  Really shocking. USAA is now a very segmented organization and I have dealt with many departments over the years (investments, banking, credit cards, insurance, legal, online access and more).  I needed to have overarching changes made to my father&#x2019;s various investment and banking accounts (member since 1952).  The headaches, and the number of phone calls (working through their phone system repeatedly and on hold, and the security questions needing to be answered every time) that ensued were endless.  Each department would either transfer me to another, or simply say, I cannot help you with that. No apologies, at times an attitude of &#x201c;I&#x2019;m doing you a favor to handle this one issue&#x201d;.  So, repetition with questions and my need to get the new rep in another department up to speed on my needs.  Hours and hours on the phone, and I&#x2019;m not done yet. 2) Duplication/inefficiency of work.   Many forms are online, but of course, not the one I need (phone call, hold, security questions);  the &#x201c;convenience&#x201d; of submitting forms through the online portal is problematic, however; there is a limit to the size of the file one can download. This requires multiple file submissions. My most recent such electronic submission was 2 weeks ago, and yesterday I was told that the second part of the submission was missing, and I need to be resend the ENTIRE package.  I opted to submit by mail.    3)  Asking too much of members.   I had to change my account name (several phones calls from USAA, questions about who I REALLY am(?!) and another need to create letter and submit via their electronic portal) because legal documents used my full legal name and my account had an initial for my first name (remember:  I am a member for 30+ years)&#x2026;more work.  4)  Bad advice See 1) above&#x2026;.most egregious example of bad advice.  I have received different answers from different reps on the same question numerous times, so training is a big problem. In my experience, one cannot rely on the accuracy of any information provided by a USAA representative, since the latest representative I speak to frequently contradicts what I had been told by the previous representative I spoke to. Also, USAA representatives have recommended to me USAA mutual fund products with low scores/low returns as graded by independent mutual fund rating services, but with the highest fees.  USAA wins, member does not.  5) Expensive Several years ago, we USAA members endured the switchover to the new Fidelity trading platform.  Surprise&#x2026;USAA trading fees went up&#x2026;a lot.  If I currently traded directly on the Fidelity platform, I would pay about $5 trade&#x2026;it&#x2019;s about $9/trade on the USAA site.  Jacking up auto insurance rates, a lot, for a traffic event requiring no payment by USAA (my new insurer did not see this event as a problem elevating my risk as a driver)&#x2026;finding any reason to jack up fees.  When this happened to me, I switched, after decades, from using USAA as my auto insurance provider.  Bottom line:  I would not join USAA at this point.  I feel &#x201c;stuck&#x201d; using USAA for my elderly father&#x2019;s affairs (don&#x2019;t push me, USAA, it&#x2019;s not impossible to yank those accounts), but I am pulling as much personal stuff away from them as I can.  I will close all USAA accounts at the earliest possible opportunity.

Online checking has issues with maintaining real time account balances and activities in some areas.  Recently incurred a 2 hour gap in time with -15.00 in balance before I could make deposits and appeared to keep from taping my linked credit card for overdraft protection, but the next day my card showed an increase in balance without the corresponding deposit into the checking account!!  This is not a very cohesive process and can be very confusing if you do not stay on top of things.  ACH payment request from an outside creditor posted yesterday(requested 5 days ago) and one day later, sill does not show up in my USAA checking debit ledger.  Still shows $1200 more in available balance than what actually is there.  I am just not comfortable with the inability of their system to keep up real time accounting.

Do *not* get a credit card through USAA! I was near maxing out my credit card because of a large unexpected expense. I had excellent credit, so instead of paying it off monthly, I decided to pay it off in one large sum with a withdrawal of $10k from my 401k (so that it wouldn&#x2019;t hurt my credit). This obviously cost me upfront (taxes/penalty) and in the long run (less to retire on), but I figured I&#x2019;d just use the cc for everyday purchases, continue to pay it monthly, collect rewards, and keep my excellent credit (as I am looking to purchase a home)&#x2014;so it would be worth it in the end. But immediately after, USAA notifies me that they are lowering my credit limit all the way down to my remaining balance. So that I am then maxed out again!!! I called to explain what I did and why, and they said they feel it is in the best interest of USAA, so they will not be reversing their decision!!

Easy bank to deal with but card cannot be converted, the CD your money goes into has a terrible interest rate. You can no longer add to your CD. There's also a yearly fee I strongly suggest you get a card elsewhere.

My husband has been banking with this poor excuse for a bank since 2008, but after our bills, checks, etc clears this bank he's leaving and I can't wait. I deposit a loan check from the bank and they kept most of it, but they released some it but when I tired to use my card to pay for a few things at Walmart it said my card was offline. I'm like WTH is going on??? We'll come to found out USAA took my money that they released to me back and holding it for 7 to 10 days bcuz they claim they have to wait that long for the check to clear. Y'all bastards it's from a Regional Bank as* ho**. So my husband can't put no money in my account because they got my card lockdown with this BS, and if it wasn't for my credit card statement I would be stranded with nothing and would have needed to ask my husband to wire me some money. USAA claim they are for the solider, but that's a pure da* LIE unless you are this, and that but I guess they pick who they want to help. For example my husband has good credit, and we needed a loan for something a long time ago,but USAA turned my husband down with some kind of BS...but you can hold our money and gain interest off it thou. I will tell everyone I met DO NOT bank with you and run and find another bank. My neighbor was saying how y'all screwed her, and she pulled all of her money out as well. I think it was one thing she couldn't change, but she said y'all as* are the worse. Those fake as* commercial on TV are a bunch of shi*t

RUN! After we caught them sending new checks with our account on them to someone we didn&#x2019;t know, they cashed their check & wiped out our account. THEN, they sent an ATM card to someone else in a different state, who then transferred our savings to checking & tried to clean us out WHILE we were on the phone with their fraud team. We&#x2019;re completely wiped out & they still haven&#x2019;t refunded the money THEY allowed to be taken. WHO DOES THIS CRAP? Their lack of support during all of this makes us believe it&#x2019;s an inside job.  We&#x2019;re waiting for them to do the right thing & the minute we have our funds returned we will be closing our accounts.

USAA used to have good customer service, but that has deteriorated and USAA is now among the worst banks. USAA's mismanagement is so severe that it is under 2 separate recent orders from Federal Agencies relating to USAA's woefully inadequate customer service and management, as well as USAA charging illegal fees to customers. One case was brought by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the other by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and both orders are from early 2019. In one of those cases USAA had to pay millions of dollars in refunds to customers it charged illegal fees to. That is how terrible USAA's management is.  My own experience has mirrored the findings of those federal agencies--USAA makes errors in its banking, has terribly trained customer service agents, and different departments have such poor communication that it becomes impossible to get anything straightened out.  Combined with their generally inferior banking products (poor credit card rewards, terrible interest rates on savings/checking accounts, etc), there is simply no reason to be a customer of USAA.

I travel about six months a year.  I have had this card for decades.  The good: their security algorithm is sophisticated.  Genuine transactions are almost never declined, even in remote and exotic locales; but it DOES catch the occasional fraudulent charge.  No foreign transaction fee.  Good customer service. The one negative: poor foreign currency exchange rates.

Horrible experience like so many others. Stolen phone and wallet. Tranactions out of state at multiple Walmarts at 3am. No flagging my account and withdrawals of nearly $6000. USAA wont reimburse. YOUR MONEY IS NOT SAFE WITH USAA.

We had fradulent activity. They called and froze card. There were like 10 items. 2 big ones. They took care of all but the big ones and said they were good. They were not. It was to a prison money transfer company! Now we're are seriously fighting to get our $500+ back.  Also, when initially contacting them about the activity we had 4 different people tell us 4 different things. Everytime we went to the next person we would get a 'i have no idea why they would tell you that but...'.

My experience with USAA involves showing numerous homes to a buyer, then having him go to the USAA bank for his pre approval. USAA then "ASSIGNED" an agent to him. He then put in his offer with this agent he'd never met, who was not from the area, and didn't know it. This agent paid USAA 40% for the priviledge of stealing my client. From that USAA gave my client a kickback of $900. That's right, USAA made 5x more money from the agent than they gave the buyer. And I got paid nothing. In addition, they charged this vet points on his loan. He would have saved MORE MONEY going to a different back, but "HEY SOLDIER BOY!!! REBATE!!!!" Way to go, USAA?

Do not bank with USAA there customer service sucks. They lie, they tell you anything to get you off the phone. Hertz charged my card unauthorized and the are telling me I need to provide them with a receipt. I asked to speak to someone in Corporate and the refused to give me the number. Well I got it and the CEO is Stuart Parker the number is 210-498-6071. So if you are having problems with them call corporate. And file a complaint, I bet you will get some results. So I hope this helps anyone dealing with this nasty bank. So much for our Vet.

DO NOT BANK HERE . Absolutely the worst bank ever who the fuck actually hold someone&#x2019;s funds for almost 2 weeks and then on the day they are supposed to release the funds they do not release it until 10 AM completely dissatisfied

I have been a member with USAA for 10 years. I have moved hundreds of thousands of dollars through their bank. I have paid tens of thousands for their services. This bank is almost entirely digital with no physical locations. There are only 5 USAA ATM in San Diego to service clients needs for cash depositing. I have had to call them 6 times this year for the only ATM within 25 miles of my home being out of service. This latest issue is my final transaction with them. On 11/19/2018 at 7:08 I tried to deposit $500 into the ATM (#088) and it  had a malfunction. After freaking out in error for 3 minutes the machine locked up but spit back out $400 of my $500 deposited. It ate $100 and spit out a receipt that said "We encountered a problem returning your cash. Please contact your financial institution." I immediately called customer service. I was on the phone for more than 30 minutes and the representative finally said he had submitted the claim and I would be contacted in less than 2 hours to be updated on the $100 credit due. Sure enough no call back all day. I called back today 11/20 and after 20 minutes on the phone the representative said she found "no record of my call yesterday. She would file the claim and I would be contacted within 24-72 business hours with a decision on my claim". So I immediately asked to elevate to another level and the next person gave me the run around too and ended up with the same response only added to the 24-72 hour disclaimer saying, "there would be a decision that could result in permanent, temporary, or no credit given". So after two calls and more than an hour on the phone this is how I am treated. What a terrible institution. It has gone downhill fast in 10 years. They have plenty of money to spend on commercials during NFL games, but not to take care of their veteran service members or to maintain and update equipment.

This is the worst bank that I have ever dealt with,I&#x2019;ve been an account holder for over10years, the customer service is terrible can&#x2019;t talk to anyone with out having to continue to verify who you are. When you ask to speak to customer service to report these problems no one will connect you to the person that you asked for. Good rates good customer service from insurance side great help from hurricane damage just sustained but the overall customer service is crap, since I can&#x2019;t talk to somebody in charge I will have to go elsewhere. False and misleading advertising.

I have a secured card and have to pay annual fees.  I just got charged again and wanted to switch from the secured to preferred cash rewards card but they will not return my fee paid for the old card and give me a hard credit hit on the new one.  USAA is not the greatest as advertised.  I kept getting hit on my credit score monthly because I used more than 1/2 of my available credit so the drop my credit score for that too even though I pay the total balance monthly.

I&#x2019;ve been with USAA since 2012, and am still receiving the prompt and excellent customer service I was introduced to in the beginning. USAA is my primary bank, and will continue to be. Unlike other banks I&#x2019;ve had in the past, when I deposit a check, the funds are available immediately, and my balances are updated in real-time! I could go on and on about USAA, but just know that when you open your accounts with them, you and your money are in capable hands!

Opened a dispute because I was double charged at a bar. USAA closed the ticket wihtout reaching out to me. When I called to get an explanation I was transfered SIX TIMES before I made someone talk to me. Incompetent employees who don't know what their job is. In the end they denied my dispute because I didn't keep the paper receipt.

If your active duty or a veteran, you REALLY need to belong to USAA!  They treat us GREAT! best auto insurance, Cell phone insurance, best checking and savings account! You can pretty much use them FOR EVERYTHING and pay IN ONE SPOT! Their secured Visa helped me from being in a rut at a 600 credit score to a 650 in just a couple purchase and payments!

Usaa never pay ligitamint claims not for active duty military. Been 2 years and am forced to sue on claim wont even good will negotiate. Great at taking your money. But wont pay claim if you have one.Do Not buy Military Familys

Run. Don't look back. You will never get a claim paid without accusation of some sort. They also do not have any compassion for the loss of your property,  then they change adjusters on your like they change their clothes daily.

I have had my card three years and twice had my limit reduced without any negative action on my part.  My credit score is well above 700 and I&#39;ve never been late but twice they took it upon themselves not only to reduce my limit, but to reduce it so much it changed my debt to balance ratio to well over 90% which hurts my credit score.  They don&#39;t care about their customers.  Choose another.

I&#x2019;ve been a USAA member for 22 years and had generally been happy with USAA.  However, USAA has recently exhibited mind-boggling incompetence which resulted in all my accounts being closed due to USAA&#x2019;s error.  One day last year, without warning or explanation, I got a letter in the mail from USAA saying that it was closing all of my accounts in 30 days.  Figuring this must be a mistake, I called USAA customer service to ask what was going on.  I was told that USAA had decided to stop doing business with me, that the decision is final, and that no reason would be given to me.  This meant that my children&#x2019;s college accounts would be closed, my wife&#x2019;s and my retirement accounts would be closed, and our checking account and credit card would be closed.  I pleaded to customer service supervisors for an explanation, knowing this must be a mistake, but they said they did not have access to the reason for the decision.  True to their word, USAA closed all my accounts 30 days later.  They even charged me a $20 account termination fee for closing one of the accounts.  Most of my cost, though, was the hours I had to spend to move all my accounts and business to new banks and to file paperwork to avoid taxes on the closed education savings accounts.  I thought long and hard about what could have prompted USAA to want to close my accounts.  Then I remembered that about 6 months earlier, I had received a suspicious voicemail from someone claiming to be from USAA wanting to talk to me about activity in my checking account and asking me to call him at an unlisted number.  Recognizing this as a possible phishing scam, I had instead called USAA&#x2019;s main customer service number, told them about the voicemail and the name the caller gave, told them that I&#x2019;m happy to answer any questions they have, and asked them what I should do.  They had said that they had no record of anyone from USAA trying to call me, that it was probably a phishing attempt, and that I should ignore it and forward a transcript of the voicemail to abuse@usaa.com .  I did exactly that (and received no response).  Now that USAA decided to shut down all my accounts, I began to wonder whether that voicemail actually *was* from USAA and my lack of a return call to the given unlisted number was why USAA was unhappy with me.  I wrote to USAA customer service asking whether that voicemail from 6 months ago was in fact from USAA and whether that was related to them closing my accounts.  In the letter, I said that if the caller wanting to ask about my account was indeed from USAA, I remain willing to answer any questions they had, since I&#x2019;ve done nothing wrong and have nothing to hide.  USAA did not respond to my letter.  Despite all my financial accounts with USAA being closed, I still had car insurance with USAA.  When I logged in to USAA&#x2019;s website a month later to get my latest insurance statement, I found that my online access had been suspended.  I called USAA customer service and asked for my account to be unlocked so that I could access my insurance statement.  The USAA representative kindly unlocked my account and then, without me asking him to, read me the notes in USAA&#x2019;s file about me.  The notes apparently said that USAA had received a letter from me asking why my account was closed, that letter had been forwarded to the office of the CEO, that they had investigated and found that the voicemail I had received 6 months earlier *was*, in fact, from USAA, and that no response should be given to me.  The USAA customer service representative said that he had never seen anything like this in his many years working at USAA.  He said USAA would only drop a customer if the customer committed a grave violation and that there would typically be warnings given.  He reviewed my account himself and said he saw no record of any warnings nor any suspicious activity.  He agreed that my not returning the voicemail probably contributed to USAA&#x2019;s decision, though he didn&#x2019;t know the reason.  He agreed that I had done the prudent thing by contacting USAA customer service when receiving a call asking me to call back at a non-USAA number.  He recommended that I write to the office of the CEO and explain everything.  So, as suggested, I wrote to the CEO of USAA and explained how I have only ever acted in good faith to protect USAA, that I have not done anything against USAA&#x2019;s interests to my knowledge, that USAA seems to have erred in telling me that they had not contacted me when they had, that USAA&#x2019;s error seems to have led to USAA&#x2019;s decision to close my accounts, that their account closing fee is unfair since I didn&#x2019;t *choose* to close the account, and that it was poor customer service for them to not respond to my earlier letter despite the fact that they realized they had erred when they researched the matter.  To this, I got a curt response saying that they had a right to stop doing business with me, that they exercised that right, and that they will not be writing to me further on this topic.  I wonder what I did to get this treatment from USAA.  One one hand, whatever it was must have been very minor, since they only bothered to leave me a voicemail asking about it (no email or letter) and they let me go on using my account for most of a year after that.  On the other hand, whatever it was must have been so severe as to justify shutting down all of my family&#x2019;s accounts without explanation and to get no reconsideration when the matter was escalated to USAA&#x2019;s CEO.  Since then, 9 months have passed.  I recently got a personal credit card invitation from USAA offering a $200 introductory bonus.  I thought to myself that USAA must have finally come to its senses and removed me from its blacklist.  I applied for the card and was accepted by USAA.  However, several days after using the card for the first time (to buy baseball tickets for my family), my account was shut down without notice.  No bonus was paid to me.  I received a letter in the mail saying that my account was shut down &#x201c;for unacceptable behavior or activity&#x201d;.  I called USAA to ask what the unacceptable behavior or activity was.  The USAA representative, after putting me on a long hold, told me that my account was closed for the same reason why my accounts were closed last year.  I explained that I&#x2019;d never gotten a reason last year and this was the first I&#x2019;d heard of &#x201c;unacceptable behavior or activity&#x201d;.  I asked if he could share details.  He replied that he had no further information for me.  Since opening that credit account, I&#x2019;ve received three more credit card offers from USAA.  I won&#x2019;t bother trying to accept them.  It&#x2019;s sad that a once great company like USAA has such a bad case of organizational schizophrenia and poor customer service.  USAA has repeatedly demonstrated that its left hand has no idea what its right hand is doing.  It punishes its good, long-term customers for being conscientious and avoiding phishing scams and it is unwilling to acknowledge when it is wrong.

Got an offer in my email the offered a bonus $200. I clicked the link and applied for it. It also came with an 0% APR introductory rate until May 2019. I go to do a balance transfer to it and notice that it&#39;s say I have no promotion, no introductory rate, and no grace period. False advertising and now I have to take time out of my day to call USAA so they can fix their mistake. The only reason I got the card was the bonus offer and because I wanted to do a balance transfer.

I would  NEVER ever  have  a  card  from  USAA .. I have  outstanding  credit  and  they refused to  give my  card a increase where  Discover  and  Chase  did in  3 months  more  than I will ever  need and all this  with  out my  request..hmm wonder if its because I pay  my  card off  every month  ???

This company has the worst customer service I have ever seen. You will get nowhere when you need help. They change the rules mid stream and you will get screwed with the rewards. Beware of dealing with USAA visa

I have been a member of USAA for 20 years!  They are AWESOME!  The customer service is an A+ team!  They always try to understand and deliver the best service they can.  Recently I had two separate disputes which were investigated by their teams and funds were returned to my accounts.      I have children that have accounts as well which makes transferring funds super simple instead of running to an ATM all the time!  We suffered through a short era where they held funds on checks deposited due to our balances...we were living paycheck to paycheck and it made it difficult.  USAA no longer holds the funds so banking has once again become  a pleasant experience!     Their online banking is top notch.  I can do just about anything from the comfort of my home or wherever I am with my cell phone!  I have no plans to leave USAA!

Absolutely terrible underwriting and customer service.  They don&#039;t care at all about their long-term good customers.  They are not the customer-friendly company that they advertise.  The only think they care about is profits.

Great rewards, no annual fees.  The APR is high like all credit cards but can easily be avoided by paying off the balance every month.  I use it for my gas, groceries and other expenses that I was going to buy anyways and bank the rewards money in my savings.

I have had this USAA credit card for many years.  I recently had my card stolen from the YMCA and reported it before any charges could be made.  USAA charged me over $14 to expedite mailing my new card to me.  NO other companies to my knowledge charge you to expedite or mail a card to you!  I will be using another card with better rewards.  Very disappointed.

My wife and I have had a USAA Visa credit card for 25 years. We use the card frequently and always paid the bill. Never had an issue. Never any collection activity on our account. 25 years. I recently contacted USAA to raise our credit limit from $15,000.00 as we were about to start a home renovation project and wanted the additional flexibility. 800+ credit score. Slam dunk, right? The (robot) rep runs through the questions and lo and behold we're declined!! I was stunned. I asked to discuss with a manager. Five minutes later Amy, a manager, gets on the line and after sympathizing reiterates that the answer is no. I remind her of our 25 year relationship with USAA. Bills always paid. The kind of customer that most companies would like, right? No dice. Denied. "I'm so sorry. I understand that it's frustrating", she says. Now I'm on the receiving end of fake sympathy and condescension. Nice. So now I'll pay off the card and close the account after 25 years. Ridiculous.  I might add that my 21 year old son who makes $11 an hour recently received his first credit card from PNC Bank with a $25,000.00 limit. Go figure.

Handy features hiding horrible customer service, total lack of protection of funds, and tons of hidden fees.  They seem more than happy throw their customers under the bus and then throw fines at them.  Can't stress enough to avoid this bank at all costs.  Don't get tricked by some handy features like mobile check scanning, other banks have this.

I have been banking with USAA for years now, and I used to rave about excellent they were. I recommended them to family and friends, telling them, "Every time I hang up with USAA, I'm in a better mood than I was when I called, because they're THAT good at helping resolve issues." That level of customer service is gone now, and the bank has been slowly going downhill for the past couple of years. I would like to say that with the exception of one or two times, the customer service representatives are extremely friendly, but their banking/company policies and supervisors are no longer customer-friendly.   A few issues...   One: I called with an issue with my debit card. They helped me figure out what was going on, and I thought that was the end of it. However, a week or so later, a new debit card showed up at my mom's house (the address that was still on my account, as I was temporarily working out of town), and around the same time, a pin number was mailed separately, also to my mom's house. I called them, and asked why they sent a new card, and they couldn't tell me. They tried to do a little research, before just telling me, "We don't know. You should just destroy it if you don't want it." This is scary, and a HUGE security concern. A debit card was not ordered, yet one was sent without my authorization along with a pin number. Anyone could have taken the card and pin number, and once activated, my existing card would've stopped working and they would've had full access to my accounts. The customer service rep was unconcerned with the issue and treating me like I was over-reacting.  Two: I deposited a small cashier's check ($500) into my USAA checking account. This is not my primary checking account, but I do have automatic deposits that go in twice a month for at least 4x that amount, which I always withdraw immediately and take to my primary brick & mortar bank. I deposited the cashier's check via mobile, because that's the only way to do it, and was not told that the funds would be placed on a hold. I was out of town for work at the time and due to an issue with my primary bank, I needed those funds to be available immediately. As any person in banking should know, cashier's checks are VERIFIED funds and should be available instantly. I called IMMEDIATELY about the hold, they told me it's because my current balance was less than the amount of the check. I reminded them about the automatic deposits I have (one of which was due within the next few days) that would more than cover the cashier's check if it bounced (which would not happen, because those are verified funds). They said it didn't matter. I told them, please cancel the deposit, because I need this cash immediately, and I planned to take the cashier's check to the bank on which it was drawn so I could cash it and receive funds immediately, to sustain me until the issue with my primary bank was resolved. They said they can't cancel the deposit because it was already made through the mobile app, and there was no way to cancel it. This was within 5 minutes of making the deposit, and they're telling me there is NO way to cancel it.... that doesn't make sense to me. I asked them, "What if someone made a mistake and accidentally deposited the wrong check into the wrong account - you're telling me there is no way to undo that?" They confirmed, there is no way to do that. So don't make any mistakes, ever, because USAA will screw you over.   Three: The mobile app always gives me an error when I try to increase my debit card daily withdraw limit, something about needing to verify identity with a text code, which I never receive via text. I need to increase my limit at least once a month, because it defaults to $600, and I always have to withdraw the money from my auto-deposits to take it to my primary bank. So every month, when it's time for me to withdraw the money, I have to call them to change the limit. This, in itself, is frustrating enough, especially when I'm often on hold for 10-15 minutes just to change my limit and get access to MY money. Last week, I called them as usual to change my limit and was told that they can't do that, due to some issue with my auto-insurance policy payment. I haven't had auto insurance with USAA in over 3 years (because they screwed me over in regards to a claim, but that's a whole different complaint.) I asked what issue they were seeing, and they couldn't tell me. They told me I had to speak to the auto insurance department, so I was transferred to them. At this point, I've been on the phone for half an hour while sitting outside the ATM that I planned to use. I spoke to the insurance department, they assured me that there were no issues with the long-closed policy/account, and transferred me back to the banking dept. Banking again told me that they wouldn't change my limit. The guy checked with his supervisor/"specialist" and they were the ones who would not approve it, and told him no. I asked to speak with that person. He said, "No, you can't speak with him. He told me what to tell you and that's that." So basically, they're barring me access to my money, because their departments aren't properly communicating with each other. I told the rep, verbatim, "This is bulls***. That's my money, and I need to withdraw it NOW." He told me that I was being abusive, and hung up on me.   Which brings me to number four: As a workaround for these idiots not letting me increase my limit to withdraw my cash, I told them to transfer the entire balance of my account to my boyfriend's account, which is also with USAA. They confirmed the transfer went through. My boyfriend was in a different state at the time and quite unavailable due to work training, but I needed him to take the money out of his USAA account, mobile-deposit it in his account with our primary bank, then transfer it into my account with our primary bank. (Needless to say, at this point, I'm very angry and frustrated with this runaround process to get my money.) So this was on a Friday. He didn't get out of training until after banks were closed on Friday and was not able to put the money into our primary bank. On Saturday, I woke up, checked my USAA account, and ALL the money I had transferred the day before was back in my account. I called USAA to ask them WTF. The rep, who was quite friendly, said, "I'm really sorry, but it appears they didn't put the transfer through yesterday." She told me to check with my boyfriend to see if he had the money in his account. He was going to be unavailable all day due to training, but I tried to reach him anyway. After a couple hours of not being able to reach him, I called USAA back and explained the situation again, and told them that I needed the money to be in his account, but that I was concerned that if I moved it over again, the money would be taken from my account twice. The rep assured me (for the 5th time) that the transfer did not go through on Friday for some reason, and that there was no possibility of the money being taken twice. Lo and behold, I woke up on Tuesday (FOUR days after the original transfer) to a HUGE negative balance, over $2,000 in the hole. Plus, I was charged overdraft fees for the second transfer, AND for every debit card transaction that had posted the night before. To make this long story a little shorter, I called USAA and was told that it wasn't their fault, and I needed to just have my boyfriend transfer the money back into my account. They would not help with the fees, nor did they offer any explanation for how they simply lost a $2k money transfer for four days.   They are useless, and no longer have a policy of helping their customers. This bank used to be great. Now I'm in the process of switching over my direct deposits so I can wash my hands of USAA completely. They screwed me over on auto insurance, and now they are screwing me over in the banking department. Take your money elsewhere, you will avoid a huge headache and frustration.

I started a USAA account when I was 17 and I had my identity stolen which affected my checking and savings accounts with USAA. Someone hacked my account and took out fraudulent money. USAA held me responsible and took all of my money in my checking and savings and left me with $0. They refuse to give me my money back and hold me accountable for the fraud. They have treated me with much disrespect and go back on everything they claim. Would not recommend USAA to anyone.

Do not use it out of the USA to rent a car because you'll be on your own. My card was charged  x 3  by an american rental car company after I returned a rented car,  I reported it to this bank 3 mos ago and not even temporary credit has been issued while investigating the charges. When call this bank to find out result of the investigation each and every representative I have talked to play stupid and tell you they don't know anything about it and tell you they would write a note but yet when you call the following day, the next representative do not see the note written the day before. Shady business....PS..they would charge interests on the above charges which they are not supposed to while it's under investigation(dispute) no wonder why they wouldn't issue you the temporary credit. Always check your balances and payment deductions.

I have my account with USAA before I deployed overseas.  They have always been helpful and have a great website that helps to track my accounts.  When my debit card was used many states away - they notified me to verify and were quick at restoring the funds.  I would *highly* recommend them from customer service, to getting ATM fees reimbursed to security.  I have never had a bad experience with USAA

It's a great card. The rewards rate is nice for someone just starting out, like me. However, I rate the card this way because it's hard to find it accepted in many places. People told me to avoid american express, but at first glance I just couldn't see why. However, not having the card accepted on many websites and stores is so frustrating, especially when trying to build credit. No complaints from the customer service, in fact, it's the best part. Any time I have called them has been a complete breeze and the rep is always friendly. If the card was accepted in more places, I would rate it much higher.

I am generally happy with this credit card, but it doesn't really go above an beyond like my other credit card that I have. I would recommend it to others, but with the advice to try to pay everything off every month or else the charges will be a lot. The convenience charges on a few random thing is easily avoidable, so it is something people like me who want to keep a great credit and pay minimum for a credit card go for. The customer service on this is just OK. Not great, but doesn't give you such a hard time either like some companies.

I requested this card because I use USAA as a bank and I wanted a way to accumulate airline miles. This card serves and gives me exactly what I need and the customer service through USAA is top notch I never have a thing to complain about.

I am a disabled Military Veteran, who has been forward deployed three times. The most famous of these deployments included operational support for the mission that resulted in the termination of Osama Bin Laden. I have also been a USAA member for over a decade and to be honest they have always done a great job for me. However I soon realized that their support ends as soon as you’re no longer a profitable asset to their bottom line profits. The following is the story of how USAA helped me get victimized and then turned their back on me.  After receiving an honorable discharge from the Navy and being sent out into the workforce as a Disabled Veteran I had a really hard time finding a job. I later learned that job seekers are often preyed on by con-men. After months of filling out hundreds of applications I finally received a job offer as a project manager for an international consulting firm. I made it through 2 rounds of phone interviews and signed my employment contract. My first month was training which consisted of 10 extensive and graded training exercise assignments. Towards the end of the month I had finished all the required training, so they assigned me to join my first project. My first assignment was purchase order research. I compiled a list of U.S. based sellers for a list of office equipment they needed for a client. After that they sent me a purchase order and told me to purchase the goods and send them to the client of record. Even though I had been working with this company every day for a month, I still have a hard time fully trusting anyone because I am a very cautious individual, so I immediately called USAA to ask how I could make sure this isn’t a con. I had a 2 part plan to ensure my safety. 1) They transfer me the funds first and I wait till the money is cleared by USAA, 2) I have the consulting firm transfer the funds onto a credit card that is already maxed out, which would free up the cards available funds to allow me to execute on the purchase order. Before doing anything I called USAA and asked them about my plan. I was informed that USAA could not change my card’s available credit without my permission, so given the the card was already maxed out it would be impossible to take on additional liability. I was also advised that once my card received the funds and the funds were cleared by USAA that the funds were safe for spending. After speaking with USAA I felt confident moving forward. The funds were then deposited into my account and cleared for spending. I executed on the purchase order and sent the items to the client of record on the purchase order. Two days later the funds were somehow virtually pulled back off my credit card and my card was left overdrafted by nearly $7,000. When I confronted USAA they informed me that they don’t know how the funds were able to be pulled out once they were in and cleared. Also they did not raise my credit limit, but rather they allowed the card to be overdrawn by nearly double it’s available limit. They apologized for the inaccurate information they provided and told me they will not help me with any of the liability, and additionally they will not even help restructure the debt. I’m now stuck with a credit card that is overdrawn by $7,000 (double the card’s limit). I don’t have a job so I have no way of paying this. The company that employed me, then proceeded to virtually 100% vanish. Everything from their website, phone numbers, emails and all my company contacts no longer existed. Then USAA, a company that I thought I could trust, and use for all of my banking, insurance, and credit accounts assisted this terrible con in leaving me unaware, misinformed and financially screwed.  USAA provided me bad information, which led to me being victimized, which lead to them raking in amazing amount of money from me in overdraft fees and destroying my credit. I don’t believe this was premeditated, but man it really worked out great for USAA. I’m sure they're having a very merry Christmas.

One of the great things about this card is that the security deposit you provide is invested into a CD account for you. As long as you're making your payments on time, you'll be getting a great return on this account, in addition to improving your credit. With a low annual fee, I highly recommend this card for those eligible for it.

Balance transfer rate is optimum. APR seems to be very high. Annual fee is none, this is very good feature.2% cash back on up to $3,000 in supermarket purchases per year can be increased.MAX PENALTY APR  and MAX OVERLIMIT FEE  is fair.According to me, MAX LATE FEE is high. CASH ADVANCE RATE and CASH ADVANCE FEE is fine.

Really love this card, I initially wanted it for the points. When I got it I was really surprised about how low the apr is. I love cards such as this that I own that offer you things back when you charge. This card overall is a win win.  Love that you can redeem certain perks through this card, I don't leave home without this card.

I have nothing but good things to say about USAA. Their customer service is wonderful and very responsive. I have average credit and was still offered a good limit and a good APR. They have a low foreign transaction fee, which I enjoy because I do travel fairly frequently,and they don't limit their cashback to BS shifting categories. It's simple and easy.

Love this card, has alot of features that i really like, The 0 apr for the 6 months is what really attracted me. One other thing that really interested me with this card was the fact that it has really low apr after the initial 0 apr rate for 6 months. Makes it really convenient for me to spend and it not hurt my wallet to hard to charge. Love this card and will continue to use it.

I've banked with USAA for more than 4 years now, and have been very pleased. Their customer service is excellent, and they provide many features free to their members (financial advice, etc.). I spoke with one of their employees at length over the phone as I tried to determine what type of IRA would be best for my wife and I. I have been very happy with their customer service!

I have banked with USAA for 10 years now and I absolutely love it.  I've been with previous establishments that charged me fees to even have a checking account and I had to maintain a minimum balance, etc...I always thought that was a little too invasive for a company I was trusting to hold my assets and shouldn't have to pay a fee for that.  USAA has shown me time and again that they go above and beyond for their customers and you're treated with respect.  I don't think there is a better bank out there, to be honest with you.

I have been banking with USAA for over 2 years. It has been a great experience. Their customer service is very helpful and I have not had any issues since banking with them. I like that they do not try and sell me extra things if I need to contact their customer service. I also like that I don't have any extra fees for banking with them. I would recommend USAA Bank to anyone. I feel my money and information are very secure with USAA.

I have been with USAA bank for about a year now. I have been very satisfied with them. their customer service is top notch and they have always solved any issues I have had and they are very prompt as well. Transfers between accounts are very fast which is a huge plus for me. They also have no fees attached to the account. I am completely satisfied with their service.

When opening my USAA checking account I was given a promotional offer for $300 if my account had 2 direct deposits within 3 months. The payment of the $300 was very delayed and did require me to contact USAA to ensure that I received the money. I did and have been extremely happy with my account ever since. No ATM fees is great and the interest rate is much better than my old bank (Chase). I would recommend a USAA checking account.

USAA bank is phenomenal. My grandfather opened me up a checking/savings account with USAA bank after graduation high school during the summer. He was able to somehow do it all over the phone-that was very shocking ot me. We did have to fax in information and things, but the whole process was smooth and easy, no confusion or complications at all! I spoke with a woman named Delores when setting up my security questions and my oh my, she was exceptional. She was so pleasant, and vibrant and spirited she made the long process go by quickly. I have had my bank with them since then, over 9 years now and wouldn't trade it for anything! I have another bank I use for my direct deposit and it can't come close to comparing with the satisfaction I get from here! Wonderful service, absolutely no monthly charges, and really cool cards as well! Highly recommend.

I used to have an account at a big bank and for the most part it was alright, that is until I had an issue with them. I realized they didn't care at all about their customers. I was just another account and customer service couldn't be bothered with me. I left them and went with USAA bank and I have been very satisfied. The customer service has always solved whatever issue I had at the time very quickly and to my satisfaction. No fees of any kind and they give you free checks as well. Overall, you can't beat USAA if you can join them.

I have been with USAA with a checking account for about 4 years now. They have always done right by me. It's mostly a online only bank but I am fine with that. I love how transfers of funds from one account to another is instant, something I haven't seen in other banks.  Overall I'm very satisfied with USAA.

I have been with USAA for close to ten years now and I have received absolutely nothing but great customer services. USAA really has it together and offers great products, including this savings account, as well as great online and mobile features. Anytime I need to open a new account or change a service, I am able to do so hassle free. The charges associated with this savings account are minimal to none and it really is a great account to have! I highly recommend to anyone that is able to sign up for one with USAA to do so.

I have been a USAA customer for more than 15 years. To this date, I have been 100% satisfied with any product this bank has to offer. They have treated us with the upmost respect and have sought to offer us products that are better than the average bank. We use our savings account frequently. Even though they have a withdrawal limit on the savings account (6 times a month), they forgave us when we recently overwithdrew by mistake. They have constantly sought to make their customers happy. We use USAA for checking, savings, loans, investments, and auto insurance. I will never go anywhere else...

I have had a great interaction with USAA for both my banking and for this cash back rewards credit card.  I have not once had an issue with them nor have I ever seen any mistakes on my statements.  The one time I had to call about losing the card they responded immediately and I talked to a live human that spoke excellent english.

The USAA Classic Platinum Visa card offered me great flexibility even with a fair to poor credit rating.  I received my card very quickly and transferred balances from two other cards to it with no fee.

I’ve been a USAA member since I married my wife two years ago. We joke that it’s one of the best things I got in the marriage. USAA has always had amazing customer service. They are prompt and knowledgeable when you call in. Recently I was trying to work out some budgeting tools and called them to ask about opening extra accounts. They were great in informing me about all the choices and I ended up opening two additional checking accounts to aid in our budget system with no additional cost. The online banking through the app and website are great too.

I have used USAA for other financial needs and always loved the service so I decided to use them to bank with as well. It was very easy to set up an account and the bank gave me money for setting up both a checking and savings account with minimum deposits in both, which I loved. It is very easy to navigate their website online as well as their app. I have never had any complaints customer service wise either. I did have an issue with my debit card being sent to the wrong address but customer service representatives helped me to resolve that issue immediately. Overall, they are a great company to bank with.

I have been with USAA online banking for over 6 years and I have never had any problems with them. They are exclusively an online bank, but that doesn't stop them from providing excellent service to current and former service members. With them I can deposit checks online, report a lost or stolen card, report fraudulent transactions, and enjoy online banking on a secure site. They not only offer banking, but also offer car insurance at competitive rates, personal and home loans, life insurance, ect. I plan to stick with them as long as possible. They have regular business hours like most banks, but have a 24 hour hotline you can call if there are any problems that need to be solved right away with your bank account.

Has the best rewards for the ways that I use the card. Great customer service and an awesome company backing it. :)

We have been banking with this institution for over 4 years and love them. We have never had any issues with them. When my husband lost his card while gone in the Army, they gave us no trouble in rushing him another card as soon as possible. We love the online banking and mobile deposit option.

I've been with USAA a long time and have usually used a USAA Mastercard as my primary credit card.  Right now this is my everyday card due to the 1.5% rewards. I've typically found USAA's customer service to be good, and they handled a possible fraud situation to my satisfaction.  I feel like they care and are willing to help me, so that's good.  My main problem with the card is the foreign transaction fee.  I travel to Canada pretty regularly and am stung by the 1% fee.  My card is a chip card, which I personally see little value in, but all the cards are transferring over to this system so it isn't really a difference at this point.  I pay my balance off each month so late fees and APR aren't important to me.  I basically look at purchase rewards (good), customer service (good), and foreign transaction fees (not good), so I've enjoyed this card overall.

I have been a member of USAA Bank for about eight years now, and I have to say others just don't compare! The savings that they have offered are unbelievable compared to other banks and the customer service is unmatched. In addition to my banking/retirement needs they also took care of me for my car/life insurance and even helped me find the perfect car with their car buying service! When I was under the age of 25 they allowed the young driver’s fee to be waved when renting a car from them.  Even when my credit card was stolen, and purchases were made, I was refunded everything in a timely manner…I'm never leaving USAA!

The only issue I've ever had with my USAA checking account is that I have to mail in deposits, I can't make them locally, so there's a delay. I won't mail cash so I always have to change cash into a check to mail the deposit. I like USAA's checking account overall  and have had it for many years. There are no fees and I earn 1% interest, which isn't much but it's nice. I haven't had any major issues from them.

I am rating this card 5 stars simply because the APR blows my other cards out of the water. As other reviewers have mentioned, the rewards and features are not mind blowing. However, if you care about interest rates more than gimmicks, this is a good card. Truthfully, I only use credit card perks a few times per year, but the low APR comes in handy every day that interest is accrued. USAA's system is sometimes a little slow to credit payments after they are made - it can take a few days after the money leaves my bank account before it shows up in my available credit. However, if you don't live day-to-day with maxed out credit cards, this won't bother you. All in all, this is a good card to have.

USAA is one of those rare unicorns that actually know what customer service means. While they are located out of state and you can't just walk into a branch like you can most other banks, they more than make up for it with quality products and superior staff. I have been a loyal customer for 18 years, and have yet to have one single issue that involved me having to be transferred to another department or a supervisor. Without fail the first person I speak with can handle my inquiry with ease. Every one is pleasant and helpful, they have incredibly low interest credit cards in addition to interest accruing checking and savings, and they release my Direct Deposit funds as soon as they are notified of the transfer so I get paid a day early.

Been using USAA for a checking account for a few years now. I'm not in the military but they let me join anyway. I believe they have since closed registration again to only service members. This is one of the best bank accounts I've had. They really take care of you. they refund ATM fees, they don't have any monthly maintenance fees or anything like that. I once had my card stolen and someone used it to make purchases, I called up their customer support and the charge was reversed immediately. They sent me another card in the mail free of charge which I received a few days later. I am 100% happy with them.

USAA is a wonderful bank to use. They offer check deposit at different locations, but it's a perk when your significant other is a full-on member and gets check deposit over the phone. The customer service is always wonderful! I never had issues with them where it wasn't resolved. For example, I wasn't getting a utility electronic bill through my Bill Pay account. The person that helped us was very kind. She asked us multiple questions, tried her best to get an understanding of our circumstance, and communicated with her colleagues to ensure things got resolved for us. Another time, we had an issue with another person being associated with my bills. I was able to see his bills, and he was able to see mine. I talked to a USAA representative and he indicated that unfortunately he couldn't take care of the matter, since the other person needs to remove me. Even though it wasn't cleared, the representative helped us out so much. We felt like a person, not a number. The customer service is the reason why I stick with them and continue to do so. It's probably the best bank I've ever dealt with, especially for it not being a credit union!

We have had our savings account with USAA for over a year and we have never had any issues. It was easy to get set up, clear disclosure information and just like every other product we have with them WONDERFUL customer service! We intend to get all of our banking/loan/insurance products switched over to USAA they have been great!

I've been using USAA now since 2002 and have found them to be extremely easy to work with and very helpful during interactions. The ATM fee rebate is one of the best aspects of this account over another banks. No fee banking is also a big plus, and their mobile app is probably the best I use.

I signed up with USAA a while back when they let people who aren't in the military join. Since then I believe they have closed it back up though, but if you can get in, they are a great bank. Free checks, reimbursed ATM fees, fantastic customer service as well. They really can't be beat.

I have been with USAA bank for a while now and have a checking account with them. They have no fees which is great, free checks and they reimburse ATM fees. You really can't go wrong with all of that. The only down side is if you need to deposit a check you have to do it in the UPS store, but I do believe they have a mobile app to make deposits as well.

USAA Bank is in my opinion the best overall bank in the country, for those who are eligible to become members.  I say this because of the incredible breadth of services they offer.  They have the best interest rates in the industry, and their customer service has gone above and beyond to provide me with the exact financial instrument I need in any given situation.  They have a built in fraud protection program I love that will not only freeze your bank card and contact you in the event of suspicious charges, but they will also refund any fraudulent charges completely.

I have been banking with USAA Federal Savings Bank for many years...decades to be exact. Not long ago I was closing out a home equity line of credit with them. The payment for the account was delayed by my local savings bank when an employee allowed the payment instructions to fall behind a desk.  That made my payment to USAA late. USAA honored the late payment as though it was posted on time accepting my explanation. This attitude of providing outstanding customer service is why I have remained with USAA Federal Savings Bank through all of these years.

I love USAA! I am so grateful to my father for serving in the military so he could pass down his membership to by brother and I. This savings account has a great interest rate, but more than that I love that I can access my account information anytime. The website is great, as is the app, and USAA is one of the first banks using a biometric login - your phone can actually recognize your face so you can never forget your password. I know that identity theft is a big problem, but at USAA they take care of their own and the security is top-notch. It's easy to deposit money through the phone app, and the money is in your account instantly, no holds. It's also easy to transfer money to checking, etc, instantly. This is a great savings account!

I have had an account with USAA for a few years now, ever since they opened up the service for people who aren't in the military. It's been a great bank and I'm glad I signed up. There's no local branch to do business with, but I hear you can deposit checks through the UPS store. Although I haven't done that yet. Their customer service is top notch and they will take care of you very quickly. Another huge plus with USAA bank is that there are no monthly maintenance fees and ATM fees are reimbursed to your account, which is fantastic. I highly recommend them if you can get in.

I have the USAA World MasterCard and am ambivalent about it.  It doesn't have any flashy features or overly generous rewards, but I'm happy to receive the 1% cash return on all purchases.  I do a fair amount of travel outside the country so the 1% foreign transaction fee is an important consideration.  1% isn't bad--I've certainly seen worse from Wells Fargo and AMEX, among others, but I've also seen 0% (Chase Sapphire Preferred), so this card is not ideal in that regard. USAA's customer service is solid but not great.  Once I had an unauthorized purchase that they handled efficiently.  On the other hand, I've twice had my card frozen for making foreign purchases when I warned them ahead of time I was traveling to those countries.  They unfroze my card relatively painlessly, but I never should have needed that.  This is really a no-frills card in a lot of ways.  It's solid and I continue to use it as my everyday credit card, but I could certainly find a more rewarding card and one that fits my needs better if I tried.

USAA is the best banking institution I have ever held an account with. I was able to create a USAA account after getting married into a military family last year, and I could not be more pleased. They literally have every perk: essentially unlimited free checking and savings accounts, the best credit card rates, check deposits showing up immediately after depositing using the mobile app, and fantastic customer service. They just rolled out another new feature which allows you to see your most recent credit score as well, which my husband and I love as we are planning to buy our first home next year. The only negative I can think of is that we aren't able to make cash deposits since there aren't any branch or FEDEX locations near us.

I have had a checking account with USAA for a few years now ever since they opened it up to the public. I do believe they have since closed it off again, so you may need to be a member of the armed forces in order to sign up. But if you can get in, they are a wonderful bank. No crazy fees or anything like that. Free checks, they reimburse ATM fees, Their customer service is incredible. It's also very fast to transfer money to and from the account, usually instantaneous. I highly recommend them if you can get in.

I have an account with USAA and I have been very satisfied. I had a charge appear on my account that I have no idea where it came from. I called up USAA's support and they immediately removed the charge and returned the money right away. After a few days they sent me a new debit card and all was well. I can't say anything bad about them.

I can’t say enough about my experience with a USAA savings account as well as a USAA customer. I have used USAA for a number of years now, primarily for checking accounts as well as credit cards. I was so happy with their services so I decided to pull my savings account from another bank I was using and bring that savings account to USAA. I opened the account because I knew could not get better customer service elsewhere. While I’m not necessarily earning huge interest on this account, it is effortless to maintain this account, and I can easily transfer funds from my checking account into my savings account online. I am also allowed 6 withdrawls from savings each month if need be.

I had request a car loan from them. It was really amazing deal with them. Low interest and low payments for the car loan. The customer service was really great about it. They don't call about me making a payment unless I am two weeks behind of a payment. I really recommended this bank for car loans and maybe any other services that the bank offers.

The worst experience with USAA I have ever had with my checking account is when they sent me a new debit/credit card because my account had been flagged as being compromised.  I have had a checking account with USAA since 1997.  During this time I really haven't had any issues with my checking account they couldn't fix to my satisfaction.

USAA is a great bank to be with. I have tried other banks in the past and USAA is probably the best bank out there. They are very helpful and try to understand your personal situation in life. They also help me get my debt under control and gave me free and clear financial advice. I'm really glad I switched to USAA they have really changed my way of banking. I don’t think I could ever switch to any other bank.

first of all let me say that they have a really a low annual fee. My wife and I have had no issues using this card at all. The customer service is nice from what we have had to deal with thus far. If you have USAA at all you will understand how good they are. Everything they have to offer is well worth it!

I have been with USAA for a few years now and love them. This bank makes it so easy to do everything you want to get done. I do not have a USAA bank near me so i cannot go to a bank to take out money. This is why i love that I get all my ATM fees back at the end of the month. I also use deposit at mobile, this is so easy to use and since we have a credit card through them our money is in our account immediately. If you are wonder weather or not to get a checking account here it is worth it they are awesome!

I have been with USAA for many many years. My overall experience is pretty good. The worst issues I have had is when going to a ATM my account will be plus or minus in either direction. In short, not describing the true balance. One of the times I had called in and they gave me a completely different number then what the ATM gave me. Yes I do keep a check book and ledger, but seeing different balances all the time is not good for someone my age. I must say that customer service is always good and to the point. They have always been helpful and look for ways around issues I may have.

I first switched to USAA when I purchased a new car and was told by Geico that my monthly rate would over $400. After calling a few different insurance companies I landed with USAA who's monthly rate was over 50% less with the same coverage.     Shortly after getting auto insurance through USAA I got their renter's insurance. I have made numerous claims over the years and have always received terrific customer service not to mention quick repairs.   In one instance our power went out for 3 days, which ruined all of the refrigerated food. One quick call to USAA and about 15 minutes later the replacement money was in the bank.    Another instance was after my wife was involved in an accident. Again, amazing customer service and quick help.   I was getting ready to move overseas, when I updated USAA, the rep told me that I could pay $15 a year to maintain my good history and have coverage should I go back to the States and borrow or rent a car. Great deal!  Alot of people I know also use USAA, I have yet to hear any complaints.

I opened my USAA account back in 2007 when I was 16 years old and I have had it ever since.  My dad was in the army for 21 years and him and my mom have had USAA as long as I can remember along with me, my older sister and my younger sister.  Even if you don't use it much I strongly recommend starting a USAA account.  I don't think you have to be military for the checking account and it has really cool features.  I have been able to deposit checks through the mobile app for the past 5 years which was way before any of the other guys had that technology.  They are really good about overdraft fees if you ever incur one and they will waive up to 6 of them in a year.  They offer immediate transfers between other USAA accounts and you can transfer to and from your local banks with no fee as well.  All in all I couldn't be happier with them.

My husband and I have had USAA for over 6 years now, and we are so happy banking with them! Everything is a breeze. We can deposit checks through our phone, easily make transfers, and have never had any issues with them. We also use them for our auto insurance, renters insurance, and have a credit card with them. I highly recommend USAA to all Military personnel and their families. They make things so easy, and their customer service is great. They always thank my husband for serving, or thank me for my sacrifices as a spouse whenever I call in. I urge everyone who qualifies to open an account with USAA!

I love USAA bank. I have absolutely nothing bad to say about them. There is no fees at all unlike my old bank which basically dragged me over the coals every month with fees. They even reimburse ATM charges, which I didn't know any bank would do. If you can sign up to become a member I would definitely do it. They are one of the best.

I have had numerous problems with them since I joined while in the Navy. I love that they give free checks, and waive atm fee's but I hate that there is no way to deposit cash. Mobile deposits and UPS store deposits are great but you have no way of sending cash unless you live in Texas. They have been rude to my wife and I and processed transactions incorrectly causing me a fee which they defended even though they were wrong. I have been hung up on, yelled at, and talked to rudely. This is a bank that I would not continue to use unless I lived in Texas. I currently have credit cards with them and I love that interest rate but for a everyday bank that I can deposit cash and speak to a human I'm staying local

I have had a USAA checking account for nearly 10 years now and I have been very happy with it. My husband is in the United States Air Force and that is how we were first introduced to USAA. My favorite part about my USAA checking is the ATM surcharge rebate. Because USAA does not have any physical locations, you can go to any ATM to withdrawal money, and USAA will cover the surcharges. I also love how easy it is to deposit checks with my phone. You simple take a picture of the front and back of the check, show the amount shown on the check and it will pretty much instantaneously deposit into your checking account. I love my USAA checking account.

I've been with  USAA for a few years now and I haven't had any problems with them. I've had my debit card number charged erroneously a few times and I called up customer service and they handled it very quickly. I have a few checking accounts and USAA always allows me to transfer money between them quickly and easily. No fees of any kind except for an overdraft fee if you go overdraft. My only issue with them is they won't let you use the mobile  app to deposit checks into the account unless you are a service member. As I am not one, I signed up when the service was open for anyone, that is a bit of a disappointment.   Other than that, the bank has been fantastic.

I have been with USAA for about 14 years and I love them. They have so many different products from banking to insurance. I have had my direct deposit going to them since I was in the military and I will never leave their company. They are very friendly people every time you call and will do what ever they can to solve your problems. My current husband was not military and once we got together and I introduced him to them. He will not go back to any of his others.

We love banking with USAA! They are so friendly and are always quick to solve our issues. My husband and I have been using them for over 7 years and I don't see us changing to a different bank, ever. We never feel at a disadvantage because there are no branches. We are able to do everything we need online or with the mobile banking. If we ever need to use an ATM we love that they pay the fees! They quickly caught fraudulent charges and called to confirm, waiting until I was done shopping to cancel my card.

I got this card a few years ago from USAA as one of their selected offers. I've been a USAA customer for 29 years now, so it only made sense that I accept any product they offer. They've never treated me wrong. The annual fee is pretty small compared to some other cards I've  had in the past, and their customer service is absolutely top notch. No over-limit fees. no monthly transaction fees. And best of all, the initial $250 deposit goes into an interest-bearing CD. I can't say enough about this card, and I will continue to be a USAA customer for years to come.

USAA is a wonderful company with which to bank and have a checking account. The employees are incredibly helpful on the phone and have helped me set up multiple checking accounts. I use mobile banking, and it's easy to see and use my checking accounts through the USAA app. One time, I accidentally overdrew in my main checking account. I called USAA to explain the situation, and the employee waived the overdraft fee.

Back when USAA opened up to all members of the public, and not just members of the armed forces, I signed up and have been very satisfied with their service. One thing I love about them is how fast money transfers between accounts. With most banks you have to wait days for the transfer to go through, but with them it happens instantly. Highly recommend them if you're looking for a good bank.

USAA is amazing!! Anytime you need to call them they are always there. I love this account because there are no monthly fees or withdraw fees unlike other banks. Its easy to transfer money into your savings account from another account, but it is difficult to deposit money into the account. Sometimes depositing money you have to find a bank or go to your nearest UPS store to have them deposit into their system to get to your bank. I would tell everyone that this account is great to have especially for military families.

First let me say this card is amazing!! The cash advance fee is only 3% and there is no over-limit fee which is great. What also makes this card amazing there is no one time fee and their is no monthly fee. I had this card for about two years no and I love it. Have the annual fee at $35 is great because other companies charge a much high price for quality that is not that great.

I used to be a member of USAA years ago. It was a very good bank and I had absolutely no problems at all with them. One time my account was charged for something I didn't purchase. I reported it to USAA and they returned the money immediately. With no fees of any kind, including no monthly maintenance fees, free checks, reimbursed ATM fees, this really is one of the best banks out there. The only downside is they don't have a local branch. So if you need that, another bank would be best.

I have had USAA for two years and I think they are alright. I'd very much prefer them to be a credit union. They are very nice with customer service, however I get disgusted when they try to rush me into another conversation or to join a different branch of their company. This happens every time I call. Example: If I call about filing a dispute, after I finish speaking my problem they will say, "No problem, I can help you with that, while I have you are you interested in setting up your Will through us?" Very annoying.

You can get this card as long as you have $250 or more to put into a Certificate of Deposit.  You can add more to the CD in order to up your credit limit.  This is a great card with good benefits that will help you qualify for an unsecured credit card in the future.  The card has an annual fee of $35 and USAA offers benefits such as credit monitoring for card holders.

I love USAA and have been using it since high school.  I use them for checking, savings, credit cards, renters insurance and auto insurance.  The checking account specifically is great.  Whether I as questions online through email or on the phone I get a quick response.  A few weeks ago I had an overdraft which showed a $25 fee.  I emailed USAA about it at around 11pm and when I woke up around 6 am, it was already written off because I'm a loyal customer.  They are consistently on point with their service!

I've had a checking account with USAA for about 6 years.  I've worked with a few different banks before, and USAA is the best, hands down.  Fantastic service, no hidden fees, courteous and transparent staff, plus they refund your ATM fees.  If you can get a USAA account, do it.  You won't go anywhere else.

I've been using USAA for a few years now and have always had a positive experience.  Their customer service has always been extremely helpful and courteous, they have always gone out of their way to inform me of any policy change or fee change.  They have always been quick to help me with any disputes that have come up.  If you qualify for USAA, there is no reason to look anywhere else for your banking needs.

I've had a checking account with USAA for about 5 years now. They used to only allow members of the military to join and become a member, but they recently opened their services to the general public as well. They have outstanding customer service. I once had an erroneous charge on my account and I called them and they quickly removed it. They also have instant money transfers between accounts. So if you want to move money from one account to another, they will process it instantly. No fees of any kind except an overdraft charge, but as long as you are up on your bank statements, that shouldn't be a problem.

I requisitioned a charge card in June of 2014 with USAA. I was denied a "Customary Credit Card" on account of a 2 Charge Offs, however  was offered a "USAA Classic Platinum MasterCard" with a $500 limit ($39 AF) and I acknowledged. I was told by USAA Customer Service Rep that following 6 months of on time installments I would be permitted get a CLI. At 7 months I got back to and I was advised I needed to sit tight for 1 year to get a CLI on that card, however I can request a "Consistent Credit Card". I petitioned a "USAA Rewards MasterCard" and was given $4k CL. At the point when the 1 Year point came (Last Week) I was told the record would never have the capacity to get a CLI, so I shut the record following the AF was approaching.( My Opinion is USAA, provided for me the $500 Classic card just to perceive how I would treat it, and since I made all the installments on time, they endorsed me for the Rewards Card. From that point forward they have endorsed me for a $7000 Personal Loan moreover.)

I love USAA Bank! I started a checking account with them a few years ago and now use the for Auto Insurance, Brokerage, and Savings. I like that when I transfer money into my bank from another bank (3rd party), the money shows up in my checking instantly! I'm considering a loan through USAA as well. Thank you, USAA, I look forward to growing my business with your institution!!

I've been a member of USAA for a few years now. I use them strictly for checking. I have had no complaints at all. They have incredible customer service, in fact it's the best I've seen from a bank yet. They always solve any issues I have right away. Transfering money to and from the account is instantaneous, where as some other banks take multiple days for it to clear. There's also no monthly fees or minimum deposit or balance required. Overall, I've been completely satisfied with USAA and I have no complaints at all.

I have been using USAA for the past few months after switching checking accounts and have had a really enjoyable experience. The customer service is fantastic and is top quality. I have never had any problems with this company so far. The features with the master card and other check card is very helpful. There are so many nice features and I really love the anti fraud protection. This is the best company I have ever worked with.

I have been a USAA member for 8 years now and I've never had a single problem with them.  The ability to not only see my up to date purchases in my checking account, but also have the ability to see my spending habits and how they are or are not benefiting me in my checking account is just so incredibly helpful.  There have also been a few times when I've been locked out of my account due to forgetting my pin (especially when having to activate new cards) and the customer service is always so friendly and helpful.  I've never once had my checking account attacked by another user, and it has just always been the best service I can have for my financial life.  I would never switch to another bank and will be a life-long dedicated customer of USAA.

I have been banking with USAA for several years now and have not had an issue with them for the entirety of my banking with them. I have several checkings and savings accounts with them, retirement accounts, credit cards, and have previously held loans with them.  They have great benefits such as overdraft protection with a choice of several of your accounts to draft from. ATM fee rebate (up to 15$ a month) and free checking. I do nearly all my banking business online and I love that if I do need to get in touch with someone I can log on their site and use the option to have them call me! No more waiting in long queues or having to navigate through a dial menu.  Their loan programs are easy and painless. I have applied for several loans through their site and nearly every time I am able to get a response in about 3-5 minutes. Their rates are very competitive for personal loans as well. For auto loans I primarily do Navy Federal or dealer loans as they typically offer .5-1% less than USAA.   They offer a great selection of credit cards and even with excellent credit like mine I have not found a lower APR credit card than what I have through USAA. Their rewards program is not as competitive as other merchants but it's nice to have a card that is currently sitting at just under 10% APR and drops to 4% if I deploy or PCS.  I do feel that their investment side of the house does no fare well as compared to investment agencies like Vanguard but that is probably their only downside. They are even opening branch locations in most military cities to conduct business in if you need to!

So, I went with USAA bank just about six months ago. It was one of the best financial decisions I have ever made! My account is completely free, and I'm not a student. The online banking is really convinient. I once sold my car and deposited a huge check by taking photos. I had over $6000 available instantly! It was really exciting. I've never had that great of customer service. Also, it kind of sucks that there aren't physical banks in my location, but they more than make up for it by allowing ten reimbursed ATM withdrawals a month. It's more than enough for me. I think I use max one ATM withdrawal a month. Most of the time I don't even actually need it. So it's overall really great and convenient even without having a physical location near me. Oh- another feature I love - I can connect any other bank account and manage all of my finances right there. There are so many tools on the USAA website. Especially if you're a young adult like me, it is SO beyond useful to help you begin budgeting and saving. I can't say enough about how awesome they are!

I love USAA. They are always there when you need them. Although it can be hard to deposit money into your account, they have easy access and are always available for you to when you need it. Transferring money is easy and the money is available right away. They make it easy to save because of the maximum amount of transfers allowed. That can sometimes be a pain if you need that money and do not want to incur an extra charge, but they are awesome and wouldn't change my bank in a million years!

I have been banking with USAA for over a decade and we have multiple accounts with them ranging from insurance to savings accounts. All of which we are very happy with. They are a great company to do business with and always put the customer first. We have never had a problem or issue with any of their services and we do all of our banking with them. It is easy to get in contact with customer service and your concerns and issues always come first. We are very satisfied with them as our savings bank.

I been a USAA member for about seven years. They have been very good to me and provided great services. Their insurance rates are great and  they don't have any fees in checking, except overdraft which isn't too bad. They are online only, but depositing money at UPS stores is not too bad. Their customer service is by far the best and a small thing them and Comcast have the the best wait music. Although, they have far better customer service as the people their speak decent English and actually seem to care. I feel like USAA cares because they understand that Veterans and service members are the reason they are around and they understand the hardships. They are willing to work around your credit problems and help you be debt free. I strongly recommend them for banking and much more.

We have had USAA for over 12 years as our checking account and have always been satisfied with their services. It is quick and easy to get a hold of customer service without long wait times. They are attentive and efficient in helping you with all of your questions and are genuinely concerned with your issues. I like how easy it is to transfer money and the bill pay is very convenient. All of USAA products have been great for our family and I couldn't imagine a better bank to work with.

I have banked with USAA for a little over a year. My husband is in the military and has had an account with them for several years. When we got married, I also opened an account. I absolutely love using USAA for banking. Their customer service is top notch. They are polite and helpful every time that I call. I like that I can access my money at any ATM without fees. I also like their online banking and their mobile application. USAA makes banking simple and convenient.

Don't sign up for the secured card. No benefits. Doesn't offer to convert to unsecured after having good payment history of more than a year or two. The CD rates are so low, you may earn $1 after a year. Really no benefit of having it. I'm closing my account now that I have 3 prime cards under my belt. FYI: Capital One and Citi convert from secured to unsecured after you've proven yourself. They give excellent credit limits too.

I've used several local banks for my checking account and was skeptical to move to an online bank. However, the customer service at USAA and easily online website (and app) have made my life so much easier. The application process was seamless, any issues are quickly resolved with a phone call, email or online chat and I feel like they truly care about their clients. I would recommend their services to anyone that is looking for a checking account that works for you.

Being a military family is hard enough with deployments, moving, and confusing pay grades. Luckily, there is a bank that caters to the military personnel and their families to help make things easy. Because there are no physical branches, USAA can keep rates for loans and credit cards very low and offer quality assistance to anyone that needs it with a simple phone call. The best part is, you can pass down USAA to your kids if you are military parents! They handle car insurance, home/ renters insurance, and any banking needs. I cannot recommend this bank enough.

I have been a USAA Checking account holder for 12 years. It was my first checking account and it will be my last checking account. The comfort that USAA provides me is unbeatable. Their customer service tied to a house hold name that everyone trusts has benefited me in numerous ways. I even paid with a USAA check once for a landlord deposit and he ripped it up saying if I rent with him and bank with USAA there was no need for a security deposit because he knew I could trust him. Now that is a good quality bank.  While some would argue that not having a physical location is a deal breaker, I have saved so much time from not having to go to the bank. Now with mobile deposit an actual bank is less necessary than ever.  Simply put, my life is better with USAA Checking.

We have used USAA for about 10 years now and have not had an issue with anything. The new mobile app has been invaluable to me while I am still active duty and work odd hours. They are also very alert when you have purchases outside of your normal home area. There fraud division has been excellent at helping stop an unauthorized user and even reimbursed my loses. USAA protects those of us that protect them, and I can deal with that.

My savings account is great! I opened it a few years ago for only $20. I love that there's no minimum balance needed. Transfers are easy, but you're only allowed 6 a month. I didn't like that at first, but it makes saving a lot easier. Now I don't have unlimited access to my funds, so I can't spend as often as I did before. Since I'm trying to save money this is a really nice feature. That being said, if I do need to make a transfer it only takes seconds. All of my accounts are through USAA, and I don't plan on leaving!

I love using USAA! Its so easy to navigate, and my money is easy to transfer. We do all of our banking through USAA, and have no complaints. The checking account is free, and they'll refund your ATM fees. I also love the option to upload checks. I was worried about how to make deposists, since there aren't any physical locations. But mobile deposits are so easy. USAA is the best company to work with.

This checking account is free, and they will actually refund you you're ATM fees.  I have the mobile app and it very easy to transfer funds between your different accounts.  You can even take a picture of a check you would like to deposit in order to put the money into your account.  There are no hidden fees, and you almost never need to actually go to a physical bank to conduct your business.

I have been a customer with USAA Bank as far back as I can remember. I got in by virtue of my father being affiliated with the USAA.  They really take care of their customers and treat you like one of their own. I've never had any issues and they've always been very quick and courteous to answer any questions I have.  I have both a checking and savings account with them and the terms for both are great. No fees, good interest, all you can need.  And this all ties together with excellent online and mobile functionality. If you're affiliated with the USAA or have a family member who is, definitely try this bank.

USAA has been my bank for more than 5 years. I do everything with them, from savings and loans to insurance. Their customer service couldn't be better and their websites easier to use. Their rates for insurance are cheap/fair and their personnel is friendly and cooperative. Even when I had my credit card stolen they noticed before I did and had the money back in my account with a new credit card expedited before I could fully comprehend what had happened. I highly recommend this wonderful bank!

I love my savings account. I have had my USAA savings account for 15 years now and started with just a $5 balance. I love that they don't have a minimum balance to open up the account, and it is tied to my checking account. That is convenient, since I can transfer funds between my checking and savings account either online or on my phone. The mobile app is really easy to use. Also, they don't charge any fees, and I earn interest on the money in the account.

I have been banking with USAA for about 10 years now and would highly recommend this bank for any military or dependent. I use all of their products which peak my interest out of convenience and ease. I use their checking, savings, credit cards, car loans, mutual fund investments for both retirement and savings.  I have recently also started the 529 plan for all of my children so that I can save for their college.  Even though their is not a local bank for me to go to in my area, the customer service with USAA has been amazing.  I plan on being with them till the end of time.

USAA Secure checking is awesome, I love the fact that no matter where I go in the world they refund the ATM fees.   The ability to deposit checks from your phone is a major plus.   On top of all of that they also have the best customer service out of any bank/financial institution that I've ever dealt with and every time I've needed to talk to them they've been very polite and helpful.   I highly recommend them to anyone/everyone I talk to about personal finance.

I cannot recommend this account enough. They refund any atm fees that you get for using non network atms. The account also automatically starts to accrue interest when you have the appropriate funds. With things like instant deposits from a mobile phone and great customer service, you cant go wrong with this account.

I love USAA. I have been a customer since I got my first checking account in 2000 and they have never made me question whether I should switch banks. Any problem I have ever had was readily resolved. As a teenager I overdrew my account, after calling the bank and explaining the mix up they removed the overdraft fees with very little hassle.The Customer Service Reps are top notch and have always helped fix whatever was wrong. I have multiple accounts through USAA including credit, checking, and savings accounts and my vehicle insurance as well. I would recommend them to anybody that asks. Between the services they offer, the high quality customer service and competitive rates, I plan to continue to be a USAA member for many years to come.

I have been a USAA customer for over 25 years and have always received the best customer service, prompt answers to questions and accurate information. If any problems with my account arrive, skilled personnel work with me to find the problem and get it resolved quickly. I highly recommend USAA as a full service credit union to all my friends and family. I enjoy not only a checking account, but retirement planning, money market savings and insurance for my vehicle.

I've been banking with USAA for a while now and can't say anything other than great things about them. We have our homeowner's insurance, car insurance, checking, savings, college savings plan and car loan through them. They truly have been the best choice in banking I've made! The convenience of their app is great and having my paycheck available to me in my bank account by Thursday morning every payday is an awesome perk! I plan to bank with them indefinitely!

I recently moved to USAA Banking from Bank of America, and I am so happy I did. Not only does USAA not have any monthly fees for Checking or Savings, but they also REFUND ATM fees from any other banks. That is unbelievable. Their customer service gets an A+++ for always being knowledgeable, 24/7. I called today because I wasn't sure when my debit card was going to arrive, and they pulled up that info in less than 10 seconds. They are always willing to help you out on the online website, as well, as it can be a bit confusing for new customers. So happy my father served in the Army, and I was able to work with such a great company. 10/10.

I love USAA. The best part is that  you can take a picture of a check on your phone and deposit it into your checking account. Their phone app is great and easy to use. I've been banking with them for almost 10 years now. A couple years ago, I was moving and lost all of my checkbooks. They got me new checks immediately (which was a lifesaver). Last year, I lost my debit card. They were great about putting a temporary block on it, so nobody could use it. Once I found it, they removed the block. That saved me from having to get a new card, with a new card number. USAA rocks.

I cannot praise USAA enough. I have never had better experience with any other bank. If you are in the military or eligible for a USAA account, I would highly recommend getting one. The customer service is always amazing and friendly. The accounts you can open are great. I have a savings, checking, and a few credit cards through USAA. I also have their auto insurance, which is hands down the best I've ever had. I've put in a few claims and the customer service is fast and very easy. The representatives are friendly and know their stuff. Plus they have a special line for deployed soldiers.

USAA Checking has been superb for me and my needs. While in the army, My debit card was stolen one night. I of course panicked, and called them immediately upon noticing charges appearing that I hadn't made. They assured me it was no problem, immediately removed the charges, and promised my new card would be sent express mail and I would be receiving it within the next 2 days. They really helped me out in a situation I wasn't familiar with.

Both myself and my husband have had our USAA accounts since college. I really love my savings account and all it has to offer. The minimum amount to open a savings account is relatively low, and you there are no fees or minimum balances. I use the USAA goal tracking feature to help me keep track of my savings goals. I have one account set up for emergency funds, one for regular savings, and one set up to help me save up for fun things every now and then. For how we use it, and for how much money we have saved, the interest rate isn't really high. However, we are just starting out and we're looking forward to the better interest rates as our account grows. If you transfer funds out of an account more than six times a month, they will turn that account into a checking account. We've never had that problem, but they do warn you when you go to transfer funds. Overall, it's a great account. They have helpful customer service, and I wouldn't bank with anyone else.

I absolutely love my USAA checking account! This bank is entirely online, but don't worry about the lack of physical locations. I can deposit checks via the app on my iPhone, and they deposit the funds right away. The customer service with this bank is outstanding. One time, I accidentally paid one of my bills online twice (I forgot I had set up an auto withdrawal), and they were able to help me out and get my money back in my checking account. It's secure, and they are always able to help out if I need anything. There are no monthly fees or minimum balances, which is really helpful. Also, if you aren't near a USAA ATM, you can use any ATM and they'll refund the withdrawal fees up to 6 times a month. I've loved banking with them, and I wouldn't use any other bank.

I have had a savings account with USAA for many years now and I find USAA very easy and pleasant to deal with. The interest rate is very low but for most banks this will be the same. If you have $10,000 or more the interest rate goes up to I believe .40 %. I have had to make adjustments to various transactions and every time USAA  was available and helpful in getting the situations corrected.

My husband and I have been using USAA Bank for years and we love it. They have competitive interest rates, great customer service and transferring money online to your savings account is a breeze. We use a typical savings account for our short term money savings and a money market for longer term savings such as saving up for our new cars etc. Having easy online access to separate accounts that you can transfer money between makes saving for multiple big ticket items a breeze. Overall we are very satisfied with USAA and have no plans to ever use any other bank.

I have been banking with USAA for years and have had absolutely no problems with them. They are always very helpful and go above and beyond in customer service. We travel out of the country a lot, and every time we do, USAA calls to confirm that we are the ones that are actually using our card (outside of the country). It is preventative measures like this that make me love USAA. We also have all of our insurance through USAA and have not been able to find better deals anywhere.

I've had my card for about 8 months now, and I haven't run into any problem whatsoever.  I go on their website every few days to make online payments (to stay on top of it).  Setting up automatic payments with your checking account is so easy.  The website layout is very user-friendly.  As with any other credit card, just make sure you can pay it off and utilize your credit wisely!

I have been a member of USAA for a long time and have had mostly positive experiences with them. The only problem I have had with their customer service has come in the form of adding my wife to my profile. I am married to a Filipina non-American citizen. However, I at least want it acknowledged within my bank profile that I am married. I went through the adding process and gave my wife's passport number, Philippine address, American address, along with countless other information but for whatever reason it denies my request. I then contacted customer service about the issue several times and each time they seem either unwilling to help or don't know how they can help in my specific case. Other than this, whenever I had a problem with my card or checks they were very prompt and helped me within a 24 hour window on the website or immediately by phone.

There is absolutely nothing that I don't like about USAA bank and I highly recommend it to anybody who is looking for a new bank.  Although a member of USAA for almost 50 years, I only started with the bank 10 years ago and have been kicking myself since joining for not having joined the bank when it first started. Customer service? Can't be beat! Ease in online billpaying? Same thing. Just like their parent company, USAA Bank always puts the customer first and I cannot imagine any reason that I would ever change to another bank. Whether stateside or overseas, I've never had a problem that they couldn't or didn't solve quickly and simply.

I have been a USAA customer for years and I have never had a bad experience yet! When I got married, they helped me get off of my parents account and added my husband to mine. The process could not have gone easier! I use to only have car insurance through them, but then learned that if I opened a bank account I would get a discount on my car insurance. There are so many perks of this company, I would never choose to use any other!

I just started banking with USAA earlier this year, and so far it's been a great experience. I opened a checking account with them because my bank, Commerce Bank, inconveniently doesn't have branches in Mississippi, where I live at the moment.  With USAA, I can easily make deposits at any UPS Store with my debit card. Clerk swipes it, scans my check, and we're done in a flash. My deposit posts right away, and the funds are available immediately.  My only disappointment with USAA Bank is that I can't deposit cash. I can deposit only checks and money orders (at the UPS Store or by mail) or transfer from another bank account. When you open an account, though, USAA will provide free checks, deposit slips, and envelopes. That and immediate availability of funds more than makes up for not accepting cash.

Since 2010 I have used USAA for my checking account. Even when I left the service they still gave me 110 % customer service. I never have a problem that USAA can not fix!  Plus no online monthly fees for a checking account!  I have even had problems with transactions on my card that were not authorized by me, USAA customer reps helped solve my problem while on the phone with me! They talked to me step by step about upgrading my checking account, which was a great idea! I got a new debit card and even more banking protection! USAA, you are the best!

I have been a satisfied USAA member for 15 years and one of the services I use is their checking.  We earn .01% interest on our checking account which is small but better than absolutely nothing.  We are an active duty military family and we have moved 18 times since joining USAA but they are very familiar with changing addresses and handle it smoothly.  I enjoy reading the USAA magazine we receive every month.  I am impressed that their website categorizes my spending like Quicken with categories like charity, dining, groceries, utilities.  I also like that I can see a picture of the checks I have written to remind me what it was for.  I love that they fully reimburse ATM fees from other banks up to ten a month.  I like that they store banking documents on their website.  They are a very convenient, military friendly company.

My husband has been banking with USAA for many years, but I've only been with them for about a year now and I am very impressed.  They have the most courteous and knowledgeable customer service reps that I have ever had the pleasure of doing business with.  Last Christmas  I purchased some things online from a well known department store, but they sent me the wrong items.  When I returned the items and requested a refund I thought everything was over.  Two months after the refund was deposited back into my checking account, the store charged my account for the exact amount previously refunded.  I contacted USAA and they told me not to worry, they immediately put the money back into my account, cancelled my debit card to ensure the store didn't do this again, sent me a new card, and contacted the store on my behalf to let them know they would seek legal action if they attempted to charge my account again.   They went above and beyond and exceeded my expectations. I give USAA 5 stars!

We have been banking with USAA since 2007, and have loved every minute of it.  Being military, USAA follows us everywhere we go since they are a online based banking company, and they really do cater to their military patrons.  Any issues that we have had with anything has been resolved in a courteous and timely manner.  When our cards were compromised with the Target scandal, we were sent new cards without even having to ask.  I would strongly recommend USAA to anyone that can sign up.

Absolutely fantastic service.  USAA ensures their members have premium care.  For instance, they routinely monitor my account to protect against unauthorized charges and fraud.  Their proactive service has prevented two occurrences of identity theft and completely reimbursed my expenses at no cost.  Additionally, the rewards package is great and provides easy access to a multitude of highly desirable products like gift cards, luxury items, and airline miles.  No hidden costs or fees!!

USAA is perfect for online banking. I had a series of fraudulent charges once, orders for camping supplies placed in Arkansas. I was living in Japan at the time, so there was no way that I had placed the order. USAA notified me, cancelled the charges, and did it all within 24 hours. Great offers, easy to use website, and wonderful customer service.

If you qualify to open a checking account with USAA, don’t pass it up! The USAA checking account has no monthly fees, no minimum balance and no negative account balance fee. You can deposit in person at certain UPS stores and ATMs. I’ve never had issues with this bank and their customer service people are super friendly. The USAA account app is really great and useful and offers a lot of features.

I've been a USAA member since 2008 and I must say I have always been pleased with the business. Not only do they refund 15 dollars a month in ATM fees, they also are very willing to work with you in your times of need. I've had several cases were I was close to receiving overdraft fees (and even did a few times) and I was given great customer service through the entire experience. USAA was willing to work with me and did not charge me the fee. I am very pleased to be a member and will make sure my children bank through USAA also.

This bank is very convenient if you know how to use the online banking system.  It is pretty cool being able to deposit checks through the mobile or from your computer.  The monthly ATM surcharge fee refund of $15 a month is pretty nice considering there is very little physical banks that exist around this country.  You can go to UPS Store's and other locations that offer the availability to deposit, bill pay, etc. through their location for a small fee but that's convenient if you don't have home internet capability to do it yourself.  Very little interest rebate but that's to be expected since this is not really a savings account.  I'd recommend USAA to other's and I've been a customer for almost 8 years.  The customer support is very good as well.

Right around the time that Captial One began absorbing ING Direct ( I had been with ING since they bought NetBANK!) I started looking for another online only, high interest savings / investing platform. USAA was reccomended to me by a fellow veteran. Their online application was direct and fast.  After about 3 months, I decided to take advantage of some great rates and move my everyday credit card to a new USAA card. The online form was having trouble with my out of USA address at the time, but a quick call to customer service and a smart, early escalation by the rep and in less than 10 minutes including hold time I was approved and good to go.

I cannot speak highly enough of USAA's customer service. I have held accounts with many other banks, but I appreciate the fast and thorough service I receive with USAA. As an example, I hold checking, savings, investment accounts, and my auto insurance with USAA, and have never hand a problem they were not able to answer or resolve to my satisfaction. I've deposited my money with USAA for several years now, and have always had my direct deposit with this bank due to the level of customer service and financial security they offer. Though they do not have any walk-in branches in California, I often have more contact with USAA than through local banks!

I have been using this card for a few years now. I love the amount of cash back I get, and I feel that it's more reasonable than my previously owned card. I work at a Costco so I do all my shopping there, and with it being an hours away from my home, gassing up my car every day really adds up. The bonus rewards are great and USAA customer service has always been helpful and efficient, and I've never had an impolite service rep in my years of owning this card. The credit limit is more than I need and the grace period extremely reasonable, once again more so than my previous card . Overall I love my card and have yet to have a problem with it, and I have no intentions of ever changing cards.

When I was moving to a different city I had to stop at the atm to withdraw rent money, so I could get the key to my new place. It was late in the day when I went to an atm, not a USAA atm, it was a small community bank atm. Anyways, I stopped to withdraw my money and it was processing forever and then all of a sudden it timed out, spit out a receipt so I tried again for it to only show my account balance minus the amount I had tried to withdraw but never got! I started to freak out and called USAA telling them I'm looking at the receipt and it shows I didn't get the money but USAA is showing I got the money and that I needed my money now to pay rent. I was really freaking out and crying at this point because he was apologizing and saying there wasn't anything they could do at that moment...it would take days. I told him I would be sleeping on the streets if I couldn't get the money to pay rent because obviously they're not going to just give me my key without their money. He ended up transferring me to some special department and I explained my situation to the woman who said she could give me a line of credit for the amount I need that would expire that night and then I'd need to open a case to solve the atm issue. But with the line of credit I was able to withdraw the money I needed to pay the rent..I have been with several big known banks that I know for a fact would never, ever have done something like this. I love USAA and would never go to another one.

There is absolutely nothing bad I can say about this bank. I have used other banks before and none of them have the customer service and support USAA has. When we got low on cash, we were charged an NSF fee on our checking account (as expected). I called them and explained that my husband and I were having financial problems and they reversed the charge immediately. I couldn't ask for better service and support. I call customer service and someone is on the phone immediately. I can't recommend this bank enough! *Bonus* Every fee you are charged for using an ATM - USAA pays it back to you :) Yes, really.

I've used USAA since I joined the Army 8 years ago. They monitor your account constantly and always inform you if something suspicious is going on. I don't think I will ever change banks. Some of my favorite things about the account are; returned ATM fees, automatic notification of changes to the account, and knowing that I can contact them at any time and someone would listen and give me financial advice for free.

I have been a member of USAA for over 10 years. I keep the majority of my checking and savings in USAA accounts. The interest rates are excellent and I have always received really wonderful customer service. There is very good fraud protection and I love that I am reimbursed for all ATM fees.

I have been with USAA for about 3 years now, I became a member through my wife. They have been the most helpful bank I've ever used. My wife and I were shopping and got to the checkout, once everything was rung up our card was declined. My work had just deposited a full paycheck, so I knew that we had the funds.  I called up their customer service right away and was put straight though. It turns out that the account had been frozen after our trip to the casino. USAA had noticed a large sum of money being pulled out of the account in a town several miles away. Once I confirmed the charges, the account was unfrozen and we were able to finish checking out in a timely manner. I would suggest USAA to anyone who is able to become a member.

My experience with USAA has always been excellent. I recently had a problem where my credit card was charged multiple times and the customer service representative at USAA worked with me to find the problem and an appropriate solution. I was impressed not only with the dedication they showed but also their willingness to consult other representatives to come up with a correct answer, rather than simply trying to get me off the phone. I'm glad I'm a customer.

The lack of ATM's with this bank sounds like a frustrating problem and sometimes it is. When I first started with them I was upset about the fees I was paying at other ATM's for withdrawing my own money and depositing checks. This was costing me a fortune since I frequently have to withdraw money for bills and deposit checks from work since I don't have direct deposit. Unknown to me was their fantastic rebate offer that reimburses you at the end of the month for any fees you may have payed. This was a very pleasant surprise and made my faith in this bank even stronger.

Overall, I am very happy with this bank! We haven't had any problems and the car insurance is pretty cheap. I love how you can take care of all of your products with their online website or phone app. We have had one problem. They claim to be "for military", but they seem to be second to Navy Federal. Navy Fed typically gets paid two days before payday, which is very convenient, but USAA is behind them on payday. When we spoke to them to ask why, they hit us with a bunch of policy information. We don't want policy, we want a "for the customer" attitude. Also, half of their customer service representatives have no idea what to do.

I have been with USAA for over 20 years now and can NOT say enough good things about them.  Customer Service is top notch and their online and mobile sites are amazing. You always know the status of your account, pending purchases, future scheduled transactions, everything. You honestly can not find a better bank than USAA.

I have been a customer at USAA for the past year, and their customer service is absolutely phenomenal!  I recently had to call their customer service department to verify a charge to my account, and the customer service representative was nothing but helpful and polite.  She reviewed my account for me, and did everything possible to make sure that nothing had gone wrong.  On top of that, the wait time to speak to a representative was short and my problem was resolved easily and efficiently once I had been connected.

I have been banking with usaa since 2007 and couldn't be happier. Every time I have a question or an issue they solve it or answer it quickly. Free checking and savings are great, I do all my retirement savings with them, had my car loan with them. If 1 negative I could point out is they are finicky about home loans. When I bought my home in 2009 I had about 630 credit score and even with using the VA loan which guaranteed they'd be paid even if I defaulted, they told me no. But other than that best bank ever and I've banked with BofA, and a few others...

In all i believe that USAA is a great bank but I have had some issues with USAA on trying to get a mortgage loan. I have been with USAA since 2009. I did not like that they do not want to help buyers who do not have credit. I have never wanted to have a credit card or any loans like that because I do not like debt but it's not sufficient enough to get help from the bank. I also do not like the fact that you have to do everything online instead of speaking to people face to face.

My entire experience with my USAA bank account has been positive. I have never had a more positive experience with any other bank account. I have been using them for about 4 years now and I have nothing but positive words for them. Their customer service is top notch and the USAA Deposit@mobile app is one of my favorite things about it. I love depositing checks from anywhere in a matter of seconds, very useful. I would recommend this bank to anyone and everyone.

There's nothing I can truly say negatively about any of my experiences with USAA.  I have been with them for over a decade, and not once have I had a bad experience with them.  In fact, if they offer a product (banking, insurance, travel, credit cards), I have closed accounts with other companies with which I had this product and took my business to USAA.  Their insurance is top notch, inexpensive, and easy to make a claim.  I have renter's insurance, and once I dropped my laptop and cracked the screen.  I filed a claim and got reimbursed within a few days.  There was no feeling like I had to negotiate or prove myself innocent.  They were completely fair and professional!  The checking and savings accounts I have are easy to use, especially with their iPhone App.  A few swipes on my phone, and I can transfer funds, deposit checks, and send messages to customer service.    In all of my time with USAA, I've ever only needed to call three times.  Once was my insurance claim, the second was to inquire about a daily limit on my debit card.  The last time was to change an address.  Every time was fast, easy, and I got friendly customer service representatives who sounded like they loved their job.  I will never leave USAA.  One day, I hope to get a home mortgage from them and hopefully pass down my membership to my two kids.

I have had several checking accounts over the years, most of them being local or regional banks.  None of them offer a fraction of the benefits of USAA Checking.  While I have never been in a USAA branch (do they even have them?), I have never found myself in a position to need one.  The couple of times I had a question, it was quickly answered by the phone representative.  On occasion, I do have cash that I need deposited.  This is a problem as it's not good to mail cash through the post office.  You usually have to take several steps in order to get the deposit into your account.   Their iPhone App is what all banking mobile apps should be.  Every user now can deposit checks using the phone's camera, and they walk you through every step of the process.  I literally do everything with the app and hardly ever log in to the browser version any more.  All in all, USAA is a perfect bank!

I have always been impressed with USAA from my other accounts with them but their banking truly is a pleasant experience.  I am able to use any ATM anywhere and they reimburse me the cost that I am usually charged by the other bank---outstanding!  Furthermore I can do all my deposits wherever I am on my phone!  The few times I have had to talk to them on the phone they have treated me with respect and always solved my problems quickly.  A+

I really enjoy my USAA checking account more than nearly any other bank I've banked with. Their website is easy to use and updated quickly. Whenever there is an issue, they resolve it with politeness and helpfulness, unlike so many other banks. The fact that I am reimbursed any ATM fees nationwide from any ATM I use, makes it great that I don't have to search all over for my exact bank if I need to get some cash out. I just stop at the first one I see anywhere. While I would like to see some more perks for using the account, like free stuff, most of that stuff is just gimmicks anyway. USAA's checking is a decent place to bank without a bunch of fees or headaches.

This is my most positive banking experience to date. Courteous, fast customer service and they pay a day ahead. They are very secure and automatically sent me a new card as soon as the target problem happened. Their online banking is easily accessible and their mobile banking app is easy to navigate. They also offer loans, savings, and insurance, two of which I've had a great experience with. Overall, USAA makes sure to take care of its customers, which are veterans and their families. I couldn't ask for a better bank.

USAA is the best bank I have ever had for several reasons. I love the deposit feature where you can deposit a check with your phone or scan the check and deposit it. The funds are available immediately. In addition when my check is deposited the funds are available the day before. This is a feature that I never experienced with any other bank. Also when you call customer service if you call from a number USAA has on file, they can immediately pull up all of your information without asking for every bit of personal information known to man. They only ask one verifying question. This is peace of mind for me because I feel my banking is secure. In addition the customer service agents are always very pleasant and seem eager to resolve any issue.

I've been a member with USAA since 2001.  They are hands down the best of any bank or insurance company I've ever worked with.  The only downside is that unless you live in San Antonio, you can't use a local branch.  However this is a non issue, as you can do everything online with them.  Even when there is an issue, and you call upset as the day is long, you end up in a good mood after getting off the phone with a representive.  If you are eligible for membership, you are flat out shooting yourself in the foot by not being a member already.

The products and services at USAA Bank are substantial. Everyone is so friendly and willing to help you with anything and everything. I have been banking with them for about 5 years now and have never had a problem at all with them. I have done everything from car loans to savings accounts and money markets with them. They always go above and beyond in every aspect of everything that they do! They are amazing! I highly recommend them to anyone!

My wife and I each have a USAA MasterCard World credit card and have been very pleased with it. The rewards are great, customer service is excellent, and our card-protection services are top-notch.

I opened my first checking account in over 20 years, and I was amazed at the user friendly website navigation that USAA provides.  Everything I could possibly need or use is at my finger tips, clearly labeled and easily accessible.  The few times, I have had to call USAA, any issues or questions were resolved exponentially and efficiently. I also feel very secure in banking with them because of the measures taken on a daily basis to ensure my personal and financial information is protected. Overall, it's a joy to do business with USAA.

If you use this card for gas and groceries, you really get a decent amount of cash back at the end of the year. The interest rate is really good, too, at least if you have great credit. I also love that it's an American Express card, so that I can use it for shopping at Costco, and since Costco purchases count as groceries, it works out perfectly! You also get a full 25-day grace period to pay off your balance without having to pay any interest. Woohoo!

I really love the USAA Secured Credit Card. Both I and my husband have one. You pay upfront and then use your money during the following month. Very easy, very transparent. Besides it allows me to built my credit history without taking the traditional credit card. The annual fee is $35 and is very decent compared to other credit cards.

I recently encountered an issue with my checking account and iTunes. I was able to call customer service and have my problem fixed with no hassle. The customer service agent went above and beyond to help me research and come to a solution about my problem. She was courteous and patient. They refunded the erroneous charges promptly and followed up to ensure that the problem was successfully complete. Love USAA!

I am eligible for USAA through my father who is a veteran. This card is the second credit card I have had (after a card with a local, non-chain bank that had poor rewards and an incredibly low credit limit). I am a graduate student without a lot of income and this card gave me a higher credit limit and lower rates than many competitors. I use it for as many purchases as I can to rack up reward points, because the reward program is excellent. I have already redeemed cash back rewards several times and the process is easy and quick. I recommend this card if you are eligible for USAA.

USAA is a top notch bank. Even though I have never been to a physical brick and mortar location I still feel that USAA is one of the best banks in existence. What I really like about the bank is that when I transfer or deposit money into my account I can instantly use that money, unlike certain other banks where there is a waiting period when I can see the money but can't use it without overdrawing. Also USAA's mobile app for android is a pleasure to use.

My husband is a retired National Guardsman. He has used the services of USAA for many years for a wide variety of products.  We have always had a great experience with them.  We opened a savings account with them last year. We were trying to simplify our financial life and felt that out of all of our banking possibilities, this one was the best.  We have several insurance policies for our home and auto already so adding our savings account seemed the natural next step.  We were very pleased at the ease of handling this transaction over the phone.  Their reps are always polite and knowledgeable.  We liked their interest rates compared to some of the large national chains.  They have no fees and we can easily access our accounts through our ATM card.  Overall , we have had no problems using this account and have been pleased, as always with USAA's customer service.

I joined USAA about 8 years ago. I had been a member of another financial institution popular among military members and had become dissatisfied with some of their services. USAA has always been consistent with their excellent customer service. I work for an institution that serves the military. One of our mottos is "Take care of the customer." There are rules and regulations that the employees have to follow. But in the end, the answer is always take care of the customer. USAA has always given me the impression that they follow that same creed. Some of the things that I like about USAA: ATM fee reimbursement, a la carte services, friendly customer support (refers to you by your rank title!), low car insurance rates with free towing. What I do not like is the lack of service centers to go to. One did open up near me, but it is limited. Overall USAA has never let me down as far a services, customer service and quality of support when I have an issue. They also have a really nice mobile app that works almost like the full blown website.

USAA Secured CC is a great way to rebuild credit. They have a great customer support staff and seamlessly integrate with all other USAA accounts. The APR and annual fees are perfectly reasonable and the card came in the mail in a very short period of time. I would highly recommend most USAA products to anyone that has or is interested in a USAA account. USAA has been the best bank I've ever banked with and they will have my business for a long time to come. Thank you USAA for an awesome service, and for keeping service members priorities at the forefront.

I have been using USAA since I was a teen and they have always been my first choice because of their business practices. Every transaction I have had with them has been smooth and painless. Even when a mistake caused my account to incur a fee while I was over seas. They removed it and helped me set up my account against future incidents. I refuse to switch to any other bank, even if the other bank offers a service USAA doesn't. Nobody beats the customer service. I don't believe I'll ever leave them, if they continue on with the integrity continually displayed

I have been using USAA since joining the Military and I have found that it is a wonderful bank to use! Not only are there great benefits and services for us men and women in the Armed Forces but great customer service! Once I had to call the bank to change my last name after getting married and they were so helpful and kind, even congratulating me on my new marriage. It was so sweet. They even have a way to deposit your checks into your bank account from your phone! Super helpful when you live somewhere where there are no actual banks!

My experience with USAA has been great with all of their other products. I have everything from Checking to Savings to Credit Cards to Loans. All of the products have been amazing and I couldn't have asked for a better bank. The only slip up they've ever had is with a Personal Loan I took out to cover an unexpected large bill that had came up. I had researched the loan information online on their website and ran an application. After running this, I held off until I knew it was absolutely necessary that I needed to take it. I took the loan, and they then tried to pull a payment with in 2 days that the loan was funded. This made NO sense to me at all. I went through various people until I finally had to ask for Management. Management reprocessed my loan and I had the billing cycle I originally expected - which was a payment due 25 days after funding. It took a couple calls to get this done, but ultimately it all worked out. Besides this experience, the bank has been great.

This card has been great to me over the years in and out of the military.  On active duty I was granted a promotional APR of 4% for the next 12 months every time I PCS'd (which for some of us is about every 2 years).  And there have been great offers including 0% balance transfers and 5% rebates for gas.  That's all on top of their already competitive rewards programs which vary from cash back to points you can use through a shopping service.  Further, USAA's integration with MasterCard is top notch.  I have never once had a complaint not handled or answered with care and patience.

What can I say that hasn't already been said about USAA, they're great! From the free checking to their outstanding customer service, they are easily the best bank that I have ever used. USAA originated the deposit a check by phone and the customer service reps can always figure a creative way to solve any sort of random problem. The only issue that I have with USAA is lack of brick and mortar establishments since I do not live near a large military area. However, that problem is conveniently solved since a large amount of banking can be done at most UPS stores.

This is pretty much my default credit card that I use. USAA excels in customer service, way beyond any other credit card company. I have a low rate at around 9%, but since I pay on time, I never have to pay interest. I have used this card overseas, and every time I call to inform USAA I will be overseas, I am greeted with a friendly voice that always sounds interested in me as a customer. I have over the years accrued thousands of points, but to be honest, I have never used them before. There is no monthly or annual fee, and have never had any issues with security. I use to pay with my atm card for things, but credit cards are much safer, and with USAA, all my friends who were not military are jealous they do not have this card! Only thing is, after being a customer for over 5 years, I still have not received an increase of line of credit.

I have been using USAA bank for many years now and I have always been completely satisfied with their service. They have no fees at all. No minimum amount necessary, no maintenance fees. I once had someone double charge me for something and I contacted customer service and they were able to get the matter resolved quickly and exactly the way I wanted it. I believe you have to be military or related to someone in the military to become a member now, but when I joined up that was not necessary. If you can get in and become a member I highly recommend them over the normal big banks out there.

The first thing I did as a new military spouse when exploring my benefits was sign up for an account with USAA. Years later I'm just as impressed as I was when I first opened an account with them. I've had different types of accounts with them and had different services with USAA. All of them have been positive experiences. Their customer service is top notch. Every time I need assistance I get it promptly and I'm treated with respect. No other bank has ever treated me so fairly and as an actual human being and individual. I'm never hassled, I'm never put on hold for a long time. I never call and get transferred multiple times to get hung up on. They actually brief each other and make sure you get to the right person. Not having a USAA in every city I've lived in hasn't been a problem at all. I actually just saw two new USAA branches built in my city this year. Their mobile banking is amazing. I deposit all my checks with my smartphone and I have been able to do this for years. USAA reimburses me for my ATM fees monthly so I don't have to stress about not being near one of their ATMs. USAA really is a bank I will stay with for life.

I have used USAA for a couple of years and have to say they are my favorite place to bank. No monthly fees means a lot to me. You can also setup overdraft protection by adding a credit card to your account, so in case if you overdraw it will be pulled from the credit card instead of you incurring an overdraft fee. The USAA mobile app is pretty easy to use. However, I'm not too pleased that the only way you can use the mobile check deposit you have to have an insurance product from USAA. Overall, USAA offers a good checking account.

I have been with USAA for over ten years. They have wonderful customer service. They are always polite and helpful. The online banking is easy to use. The way it is laid out gives you the opportunity to see your financial state in a quick glance.   They offer many services but do not push or make you uncomfortable. I use this bank for car insurance as well. When my husband got into an accident a couple years ago they made everything so easy. My husband had an injury to his back and the stress was overwhelming. USAA was so caring and helpful through the whole incident. They made sure we understood everything and had everything we needed.   They have member perks like discounts on car rentals, jewelry and flowers. I have saved thousands of dollars over the years on car rentals alone. I think they are the best bank around!

This is a wonderful card with a low rate and excellent rewards. We don't use this card for exceedingly large purchases, but we have already received $600 in cash rewards. These reward points can also be used for things such as gift cards, trips, fun experiences, and small kitchen appliances, among other things. Also, the customer service provided to me by USAA has been excellent. Once this card was stolen and before I even knew it, USAA had called me to let me know that I would be getting my money back. I couldn't recommend any card more than this one.

I have had an account with USAA for almost 10 years now. I have to say that USAA is the best credit union I have ever been a member of. We have had a variety of products with them throughout the years. We love their checking account because our deposit usually get deposited a full day earlier than with other banks we have belonged to. We also have insurance and a credit card with them. Any time I have had any questions or concerns with our account, the customer service department has handled everything that we have thrown at them with excellence.

This bank is incredible. I've been with USAA for 3 years now and am absolutely in love. They're quite simply the best bank I've ever used. I have always gotten all questions answered and problems solved on the first call. I am extremely happy with their products, customer service; everything. They must have excellent customer service training, because these guys are super polite. If you are eligible, USAA is certainly worth switching from a mega bank or a great alternative to a credit union. I give this bank 5 star rating and would definitely recommend to anyone eligible to get a membership.

I've been a member of USAA bank for a few years now. They used to be for members of the military only, and I actually believe they are going back to that. But for a while at least they opened their doors to anyone. I love their customer service and I have had no problems at all with them. There are a few downsides though. I mainly use them as an online bank, meaning it's too inconvenient for me to deposit checks at their branch which is too far from me. Other than that though I have had no problems at all and I love using them.

Father was in the navy and got me involved with this bank. USAA has been an amazing bank and their credit card has been a fantastic benefit for me! It has a great  interest rate along side a very professional backing. Would not chose any other bank card due to the fact that i have had so many good experiences with this company and card. Thanks USAA!

I signed up for USAA banking, as well as the American Express Credit Card once I joined the United States Air Force.  I was told they were a great bank from everyone I worked with and needed a new bank account since I had moved away from home.  I have had no issues with my bank accounts or line of credit with USAA.  Their customer support is great and have been nothng but helpful.  Also, the bonus rewards aren't bad either!  I definitely recommend USAA to anyone I know who is eligible for an account through them, and I see myself using their services for years to come.

I love my USAA Master Card!  The interest rate is very low, hovering at 10% and I receive impressive rewards. I get at least a 1% payback rate and am supplied with tons of special offers and discounts from all different sorts of retailers. The best thing about USAA has to be how the interest rate is suspended due to a deployment. Whenever I deploy to a combat zone, the interest rate is suspended for a whole year, regardless of the length of the deployment! The interest rate is also reduced to 4% whenever you PCS! This is a must have card for anyone connected with the armed services!

One of the first things I did after joining the military was sign up for USAA and try to get a credit card because I knew I needed to start building my credit. The help desk pointed me in the direction of this card, and I'm so glad they did. They have an impressively low APR on this card (and any other card from USAA in general) and they are always there for you if you need assistance of have question about your card. This card has made the difference for me and deciding if I should stick with USAA and I would definitely recommend this card to anyone who has access to it!

I have been a USAA customer for many years now. From the very beginning, I have found their products, processes, and customer service absolutely stellar. My husband and I hold several accounts of different kinds with them, along with most of our insurance policies. The deposit accounts are extremely easy to use in terms of depositing checks on line, transferring funds between accounts, online and mobile access, and customer service (both live and online).   I don't recall ever staying on hold for longer than a minute for call center customer service. Additionally, their problem resolution response time is amazing. The one time I had difficulty accessing all my family's accounts from one log-in, they put me on hold for three minutes to talk to tech support for me, came back on the phone, and assured me it would be taken care of in the next fifteen minutes. It was fixed in five.  USAA gets my full approval! If you are able to qualify for USAA membership, I strongly recommend banking with them!

I have been using USAA for checking, savings, investments, car and renters insurance for the past 10 years. Over these years their system has been progressing with the times and staying current. They have an easy to use application for smartphones where you can access your account and do almost everything you can do on a computer and even cash your checks from your phones. anytime I need help, their customer service is superb. I always get to speak to a person and not automated systems. I would recommend USAA to everyone!! I've had their services for 10 years and have no complaints. For car insurance, when my car broke down on the side of the rode they sent a tow truck out to get me, located a shop for the car to be worked on, and also got me a rental car... completely relieved about the whole situation.

I have been banking with USAA since joining the Army Reserves in college and my experience with them has been on another level compared to local banks available here in Atlanta. It has not always been easy to not have a local bank to deal with for certain items (such as notary services, money orders, and taking the kids in with their piggy bank to setup their first account) but the customer service and technology offered by USAA definitely help make up for that shortcoming. I was even able to convince my wife to get her checking account with them before we married and we've added other services (car, rental insurance, credit card) through them as well.

I love USAA.  Their online and App is phenomenal. My World MasterCard is great; 8k available, 11.2% APR, I usually keep the balance under $500.  I got $75 back from purchases last year, and get discounts here and there.  Example; 15% off when I use RedBox.  It's not much, but all the small stuff adds up.  I pay it off every month, and with the grace period, don't pay interest, so I actually make money by using it, instead of a debit card.  I also have Chase and Wells Fargo CC, which give me only a $1000 available, much higher APR, no rewards.   USAA is awesome, but I know not everyone can get it, but if you can, DO IT.  Car insurance is also great.   Full coverage on my 2006 BMW is only $75/mo, actually $30 less than my 1998 Ranger, cause I got safe car discounts.

I have this USAA Mastercard and I think it's one of the better credit cards that I have.  I've had it for about three years now and honestly cannot think of one complaint I've had with it.  I pay my bills off every month and do not carry a balance, so I never have to deal with the interest rates.  However, I believe the interest rate on this particular card is actually fairly low in comparison to some others.  USAA makes it incredibly easy to pay the bill every month if you have a checking account with them already.  All I do is just transfer over the money to pay the card and that's that.  I also signed up to have everything sent to me electronically, which is very nice.  I'd definitely recommend this card if you're able to become a member of USAA.

I have had a checking account with USAA for two years now. It has been the easiest bank I've been with by far. I do most of my banking online, so this bank is perfect for me. They do have one major downside. They don't have many locations. The closest USAA bank to me is in San Antonio, Texas and I live in the DFW metroplex. If I need to deposit cash, I just go to my local credit union and deposit cash into my account there and then transfer it to my USAA account. Other than that, they have been absolutely perfect. You can deposit checks with their mobile application and they post to your account instantly. They also have a bill pay feature, which makes paying bills incredibly easy. All in all if you have the chance, I would definitely bank with them.

I have USAA for my military banking. As a a new person in the military I got this card a few years ago because I needed one to build my credit. This credit card is great and it is a good way to boost up your credit. The rewards program is good to have because it can get you extra dollars or a little bit extra savings you can use toward other things. They have low APR and I was surprised at how low I had. They work with you to the best of their ability. I truly recommend this card to any new users that want to build their credit!

I have been with USAA for over 4 years now and I have never had such a great experience with any past bank before. The customer service offered by USAA is second to none and a shining example of how a business should be treating their customers on a day to day basis. I also have my vehicle insurance through them at a rate no one could complain about. I have had to report a couple of insurance claims and the claims representatives did everything in their power to ensure that I was fully reimbursed for the damages to my car. I have no plans on changing banks.

I have had the USAA MasterCard since the Summer of 2012. I needed it because I also have the American Express Card for USAA but that is not always accepted at many places. The card is great! I have yet to have a single problem with it and if I am ever overcharged or anything, I can call USAA and they will quickly resolve the situation. The rewards program is also another bonus because it rewards you for things you buy every day. I like to use my awards to give myself some extra cash. I would definitely recommend using USAA to any of my friends that can use this service.

USAA checking is the best checking account I have ever had. The first thing that stands out is the amazing customer service. It's not at all difficult to get an actual human being on the phone, and their hours are great. USAA definitely has people manning the phones more often than other banks, and they are much friendlier.   The other great thing about USAA checking is that they reimburse you for all your ATM fees! It doesn't matter if a fee is $1.00 or $8.00 or if the ATM is located in Texas or in Canada; you will get reimbursed every month. USAA has great credit card options and the best insurance plans around as well. I love being a member of USAA.

I have a USAA Mastercard, I got it when I first moved away to cover some of my student expenses. I'll admit that I'm not the most responsible credit card owner but they let me set a limit (which I chose to be $800) in order to compensate for my spending habits. Thanks to my intentionally low cieling and incredibly low interest rate, I can comfortably use my card without putting myself at financial risk. The customer service has been absolutely fantastic and the rewards program acts as a nice bonus on top of the whole package. Thanks USAA and Mastercard for a product that is as convenient as it is affordable.

I love my USAA checking account! We have direct deposit on our account, and our paychecks always show up a day before we are scheduled to be paid. It is so easy to use the online banking. I pay my bills online, and check my balance often – on my laptop, my iPhone, or my Kindle Fire. It is also very easy to transfer money from one account to another, a feature I use to pay my children's allowance. Customer service has always been extremely helpful, although I rarely have occasion to use it. USAA does not have their own ATMs around the country, but they allow us to use any bank's ATM and refund any bank fees (there are limits, of course). Overall, I highly recommend USAA and can't imagine ever changing our bank.

I have been a member of USAA for several years now. They are one of the best banking institutions I have ever dealt with. I opened an account with USAA primarily for the ATM reimbursements, so I could use any ATM anywhere without paying for a service fee. I still use it for that, but also enjoy using it as a primary checking and savings account. Their mobile application is one of the best I've seen. They do not have a branch office where I live, but if I need to deposit checks I can do so at any UPS Store nationwide! Thank you USAA. I will be a customer for life.

Even though USAA has only a few physical banks in the US, they make up for that lack of face to face service with the greatest phone customer support I have ever dealt with to date. Their phone representatives are always friendly, and work from the US and speak very clear English.  A couple of years ago they introduced a smartphone app that gives me the ability to access my bank from anywhere. I can check my balance, file an insurance claim, pay my bills, and even deposit checks using my cellphone camera. I started banking with USAA when I joined the military, and I will be banking with them for life.

In the early 80s when I was in the Navy I was stationed in San Diego. I lived off the base with my wife end our newborn. My wife and I opened our first account together at USAA bank. USAA struck me as the “common man’s bank.” There were no outrageous fees for opening new account or ridiculous interest rates. The customer service was beyond excellent and beyond reproach. Anytime I had to visit the branch the wait was minimal with the exception of Fridays. Almost 40 years later we still maintain a saving and checking account. Although I no longer live near a USAA branch, their online banking makes account management a breeze.

USAA is wonderful! They helped my husband and me set up a joint account and individual accounts for each of us. We thought the situation was confusing since he already had an individual account and we wanted to put my name as a secondary account holder, plus add the other two accounts, order checks, and debit cards. However, the service representative knew exactly what we meant and handled it efficiently and quickly. The representatives are always friendly and respectful, making sure to use my husband's military rank when addressing him. I am looking forward to moving my investments and insurance to their organization because they really understand how to work with military families, including dealing with moves and deployments.

I have a USAA credit card and love it. It simplifies my life. All of my shopping, including groceries, is done with this one card. I also use it to pay all my monthly home bills. That makes it easy to keep track of all my spending on one easy to understand electronic statement. I simply pay once a month for everything I purchase throughout the month.  Another benefit of using this card for every purchase is that it costs nothing providing I pay in full and I get a generous rewards program that credits my account annually. The USAA card takes all headaches and worries out of my finances.

I originally joined USAA for a convenient way to do my banking. When I found out about this card, I was surprised. It has a low APR. It has awesome rewards, and you can even choose between points and cash back. This card has no annual fee, which is awesome. I definitely recommend this card to all my buddies who have an account with USAA. The only drawback of this card is you have to have an excellent credit rating. If you've been less than diligent with your credit, you probably shouldn't even bother applying for this card. I've never had any issues with this card at all. I would definitely choose this one again if I needed a new credit card.

I have been with USAA for many years now, ever since I struck out on my own. I have used virtually all of their available services at one time or another and I have to say that they are absolutely fantastic. The review system on here limits me to only one topic at a time for the sake of this one I'll talk about credit cards. I have a student's MasterCard through USAA's credit program and it has been a lifesaver. Being a student, it can be difficult to build credit. USAA made this easy by introducing a student's credit card with relatively low approval requirements. The application was an absolute breeze to get through and the card itself was smartly implemented. Due to the rather easy to obtain nature of the card, USAA smartly places an automatic 500 dollar limit on the card in order to prevent over-use. This was also exceptionally helpful to me considering how new I was to the whole system. Now that I have had the card for years, I am able to raise my credit limit on it if I should so choose. The customer service is direct and friendly as well as helpful. My only qualm is that in order to contact customer service you must call in as there is no online chat feature. Overall though, that is a very small issue in the grand scheme of things. I cannot recommend them enough.

I've had this card since 2010, and it is the best one I own.  It offers me the stability of USAA, and the availability of MasterCard.   I have had many incidents of fraudulent charges, and MasterCard/USAA is a breeze to work with.  They have always provided me with top notch customer service, and I would recommend this card to everybody.  However, like with other cards, don't miss your payments.  Interest rates will increase.  I haven't had a limit increase in quite a while, so that may be one of the downsides as well.  But, for anyone looking to start out with credit, this is the card for you.

My family switched from a traditional brick and mortar bank to USAA bank after learning of some of their benefits. I've always thought USAA was a great company, but now I am even more convinced. Sure we don't have a bank to go by, but if we need to deposit a check, we go to a UPS Store where they can deposit the check or we do it from home via out scanner. ATMs are the best. We can use our ATM card at any ATM and USAA waives/refunds the ATM fee. It is super convenient and easy to use. Being able to do things online and manage through their website is also a great benefit and if you need a real person they are just a call away. Their bill pay works like a charm as well. I could go on and on. Wonderful bank and wonderful service.

I joined USAA in 2004 for car insurance. Then, I started banking with them, too. A few years ago I opened an American Express Cash Rewards card with USAA because I liked all their other services. They have great customer service. I have never had a problem with my card. I receive a new card in the mail before my old one expires, activating it through my online banking account is very easy, and I'm a big fan of the cash back at the end of every year. In fact, I've started using it more, rather than my lower interest rate credit card, for the end of year rewards perks. However, I only use it to the point at which I'm able to pay it off each month, because the one thing that hasn't changed is my interest rate. That is the only downside. Though I have maintained good credit, my interest rate for this card has not lowered.

I honestly can't say enough good things about USAA. All of the features you look for in another bank, free checking, no ATM fees, no minimum balance, etc aren't just benefits at USAA. It’s just the way they do business. USAA treats you like a person and not just a source of revenue like most banks. The customer service is always there when I need them, no long waits or customer service reps that have no idea what they are doing. They are always polite, helpful, and quick at resolving issues. A story I usually tell people is when I lived in this awful rental house that flooded and the landlord wanted me to pay for the damages I called USAA for advice and they helped me out, even though I didn't have rental insurance with them at the time! That's the type of service they are known for and you can expect if you qualify to join USAA.

I've had this card since 2008, and have had no problems with USAA's service. On the contrary, USAA's customer service and wide range of options are probably the best in the industry for the lucky few who get to use them. The interest rates are relatively low, and when my identity was hacked recently USAA paid back all losses without a question.  They even pursued the perpetrator. I also use checking, savings, and retirement options with USAA. They offer free advise on wealth management, and excellent online resources. I will bank with USAA until the very end, even though I will never join the military.

USAA Federal Savings Bank is now open to everyone – military and civilian alike! I've trusted them with my checking, savings, and investments for just about four years now. Out of the half dozen or so banks I've used, USAA is by far the best. The thing that has saved me multiple times is their Deposit@Mobile application. If you have a check that you need to deposit, it's so easy to just take a picture of the front and back - and BAM it's in your account. This has even worked for a money order!  I love their phone service and customer service. At other national banks, I've gone through the phone tree for 10+ minutes before I can get a real person to help me. At USAA, I recite my customer number into the phone - and BAM I get to speak to a live person. It's like I'm dealing with a small credit union in terms of their customer service!  Your banking documents stay online for years. There's no need to keep paperwork around, since USAA keeps the digital copies for you and they are accessible anytime you need them.  In addition to savings and checking, I've had great experiences using their investment products too. USAA is a great place to bank, I'd highly recommend it.

I've had USAA ever since I was in college. They were pretty good for a while. I had my insurance and credit cards through them as well. However, there are a few things that made USAA stand out aside from those other products. Specifically, USAA was one of the first banks, if not the first, to allow you to scan your checks at home to deposit them. Sometimes that didn't work, so they provided free pre-paid envelopes to mail checks in with. Pretty decent. Then, when smartphones starting popping up everywhere, they were one of the first banks to allow you to take a picture of your check to deposit it in real time. No waiting for the check to clear – the funds would be available to you immediately. When you add to that the fantastic customer service that USAA is known for, I don't have much of a reason to think about switching banks. It would be nice if their interest rates were a bit higher, but it seems like everyone is cutting those down to being almost non-existent. Still, it seems like Capital One and ING are able to get slightly higher than average rates. However, I don't think they have an annual dividend rebate for account holders, like USAA does.

I've been banking with USAA for several years now. I switched my main checking account over from Chase back when they started instituting fees for their checking. USAA has been amazing. Even though there are not a lot of bank branch locations around where I Iive, I have never found this to be a problem. They have zero fees for their checking. I love being able to deposit checks at the UPS store. I love how I can use any ATM and get reimbursed for the transaction fees. It is very freeing, not to have to worry about finding my bank's ATM in order to withdraw money. I have never had any problems with my account.

I've had this card for a few years now. For the most part, I've been pleased with the way it works. It's a basic, straightforward card with no annual fee, but you also feel that with the rewards. Only getting 1 point per dollar spent (with some exceptions for shopping through their web portal) isn't competitive with other programs; however, being able to use the points for pretty much whatever you want with no real restrictions is fantastic. Couple that with USAA's customer service and I see no reason to change for another card. However, I have had an issue with their credit limit. When I changed jobs and received a significant pay increase, there was not a remarkable change in my credit limit, which I found rather odd having made all payments on my card on time. I understand the need to make sure they aren't too exposed to risk, but it seems like they were hedging their bets too much with this one.

I have had my USAA credit card since the day I turned 18, which has been almost five years. The payments are very low and if you miss one the penalty isn't bad at all. My interest rate has only gone up once and has not changed since then. USAA also has very good customer service representatives to help you with your questions and concerns. They actually speak where you can understand them and will actually give you detail on what you need to do if there is an issue. I have had no issues with this credit card and would recommend it to all of my friends.

I have been banking with USAA for over 4 years and couldn't be happier. I have rarely had any problems, but when I have, USAA has provided quick low-stress solutions so that I can get on with my day. For example, about 6 months ago, my husband's debit card number was stolen. The card was still in his wallet, but someone attempted to use the numbers to buy new wheels for their car for over $600 and services at a salon for over $300. USAA immediately flagged the transaction, denied it, froze my husband's card and called us. We would have had no idea this was going on until we got our statement if they hadn't. It was a pain to have to wait for a new card to come in the mail with new numbers, but it only took a few days, and it's better than having had to pay the expenses.  I would recommend USAA to my family and friends in a heartbeat!

Thanks to my dad's service in the Air Force, I've been lucky enough to have been investing through USAA Federal Savings bank since I was 12 years old. I use them for checking, savings, mutual fund investing, as well as retirement opportunities including but not limited to outstanding Roth IRAs. Customer service for each of these has been particularly useful, as my identity was recently stolen. USAA resolved the matter immediately, began to pursue the perpetrator, and reimbursed me for all my losses (though it wasn't their fault).  If you are among the lucky few to be eligible for USAA banking, do yourself a favor and take advantage of it! From financial advising to reduced car insurance rates, every employee here is knowledgeable and will bend over backwards for you with a smile on their face.

I've been using various services offered by USAA for about five years now (checking, savings, personal loan, car loan, car insurance, and home insurance). To say that I use them for a one stop shop is accurate but there is a reason why...their customer service and ease of use. My view of services like the ones USAA offers is “the fewer times I have to contact them the better” (just to say it means they're doing something right). The few times I have had to contact them or been contacted by them it has been pleasant, precise and handled quickly. The only drawback to using them for a primary checking is cash deposit (only select UPS locations will accept cash for deposit into your checking account). Other than that I would highly recommend USAA to anyone “shopping” for banking services.

I cannot begin to tell you how pleased I am with USAA Bank! I have gone through many banks, both big and small, but this bank is without a doubt the best I have ever encountered. I've been with them for just over a year now. I would have joined sooner, but I didn't think I was eligible. However, now that I'm a member here, they offer a full run of services that they can tailor to you. I have numerous accounts with them and the customer service has been above what I could have ever hoped for. They have checking, savings, mutual funds, brokerage services, credit cards, you name it.   I have moved the majority of my banking over to them and plan to recommend them to all of my friends and family.

I have been with USAA bank for a few years. On several occasions I have had financial setbacks and when I needed help customer service reps were prompt and courtesy. The call menu is streamlined and secure and I have never had to wait over five minutes when seeking help. Once you input your pin code several options become available to connect you to a helpful representative. I own a checking and savings account with USAA and found their policies to be lenient and realistic. This bank really takes care of its customers by relying on feedback from their surveys.   A very helpful feature of being a USAA banker is the discounts on travel, insurance, and food items. Through USAA I have saved hundreds of dollars on my rental car expenses simply because I was a member. USAA has some of the most competitive rental car rates around. Buying insurance is a cinch. The website is so easy to use, I can navigate myself to my goal in no time. Overall I am pleased with the quality of USAA. It honestly feels like every process dealing with the customer has been perfected through personal interactions. I will continue to be a member as long as I can!

I started using USAA through my dad who worked in the Air Force and my experience so far has been nothing but positive. The website is very easy and straight-forward to use which made losing my debit card as pain-free as possible. All I had to do was report it as lost and they sent me a new one in the mail! Their site also makes transferring money as easy as a click of a button. I'm not sure how unique of a feature this is as USAA is the only bank I've used, but having the option to deposit checks from either my home or using my phone has also been a plus and saved me many trips to the bank. And I absolutely love the fact that I can use any ATM I want to without worrying about being charged.

I have been using USAA for the past 5 years and absolutely love it. I have closed two accounts with another bank because I love the mobility with USAA. They even worked with me while I was in school with my auto loan. My interest rate has only increased once in the past two years for my auto loan as well. The customer service is excellent and very fast, you are never on the phone waiting longer than 5 minutes max. I would suggest using USAA to all of my friends and family. They are one of THE best banks I have ever used.

Since I started using USAA bank for all my primary banking needs, I had attempted to use various other USAA financial services, but did not expect a whole lot due to my credit history. I could not have been more pleasantly surprised when USAA approved me for their World MasterCard as fast as they did. Within minutes I had my temporary account number set up, and was able to make purchases. Getting the card in the mail was a simple process of waiting about 7 business days. I've had this card for a couple years now, and while the interest rate is higher than I would like (my credit, not USAA's fault), I have noticed that USAA customer service treats me the same as if I was one of their top customers with excellent credit. Every issue I have ever had to contact them about has been handled promptly, and I plan on using the card for a long time when the need presents itself. I recommend this card, as well as all USAA cards for their excellent service.

I joined USAA through my father who served in the Army. Compared to other banks I have used, USAA has been absolutely fantastic. Firstly, there are zero withdrawal fees regardless of which ATM or bank you use. This is absolutely tremendous because, living in New York City, I can go to whichever bank or ATM is closest to me and not have to worry about being charged a fee. Secondly, the customer service at USAA has been fantastic. I recently lost my debit card and did not realize it until a few weeks later. When I got the bill there was a charge of 500 dollars worth of stuff that I had no idea about. I called USAA and they immediately reversed the charge with no questions asked. Compared to what I've experienced with other banks, this solidified my thought that USAA is definitely the best.

I gained access to USAA through my Grandpa who was in the Air force, and it was the first place I went to get a car loan. I was 18yrs old, had a job and steady income and without question they approved me for 5k on a 10yr old car! Even though they are based out of Texas, I still had the check from them for the loan amount in hand within 2 business days. They were very upfront about payments options, which plan I would pay the most interest on, the different rates available, not a single surprise throughout the entire process. They even went so far as to assist with insurance on the newly purchased vehicle as per requirements for the loan I received. For any vehicle I finance from here on out, I will be financing through USAA.

I have been a member of USAA since 2003.  I started out with vehicle insurance, and since then, I have gained many other services from this wonderful and supportive company.  I have owned this credit card for about 3 years now and originally used it to consolidate debt.  I have never received better service and rewards from any other company.    Paying the bill for this card is also seamless and simple if you like to do online banking.  You can make payments; check the status of payments, and the history of credit card use.  USAA even goes as far as suggesting options for spending goals, etc.  Overall, USAA is a great company that has provided a great service and as long as they continue to provide this great service, I will continue to remain a customer!

I joined USAA in the early 80's and began using the USAA Mastercard at that time. USAA has always done a great job with all of their banking services, and the credit card system has been equally great. You've got to love no annual fees, and their prompt and courteous telephone representatives. The on-line card system works well, and when I've had reason to dispute a charge, I have always had complete satisfaction with the outcome. I haven't seen any degradation of service since banking membership restrictions have been loosened, and that hopefully will remain to be the case. USAA credit cards are a fantastic way to go!

I joined USAA in the early 80's. The bank was used by many of us in the military, and had a reputation for great service, low/no fees, and was geared toward care for the needs of the servicemen/women around the world. The checking accounts used to have free check re-orders, though they now charge like the rest of the banking world. I don't believe there's much to differentiate USAA's checking from that of most other banks now, other than that USAA had such great customer service in decades past, and they seem to have been able to maintain that during the transition to serving more than just the military membership. USAA checking accounts don't pay much interest, but I think USAA has less restrictions on the balance needed in order to receive interest payments than most banks. If you're looking for a new bank, I recommend that you try USAA. They're on-line banking system is awesome!

I have been using the USAA Mastercard for 13 years now.  It is the only credit card in my wallet, and as soon as we got married and my husband was eligible for membership, he transferred all his balances to his new card and dropped the old ones.  Their low interest rate made it much easier for us to pay off our debt!  I have lost my wallet twice in that time, and their fraud protection services have always been top-notch.  I really appreciate that all their customer service reps are American and very polite.  I like that their rewards program is a straight cash rebate so I don't have to mess about with airline miles or points.  USAA has earned my loyalty and I rave about them to everyone I know.  If you or a family member have ever been in the military, check if you qualify.

I just transferred my car insurance over to USAA and decided to open some other accounts to get a discount. One of the ones I opened was a credit card account. I was very happy with the credit card I was able to get. The interest rate I received was just fantastic. My credit limit is also very high. It is very easy to pay the credit card bill too. They have a system online that will alert you when it is time to make a payment. I would highly recommend this card to anyone who needs a credit card.

I recently joined USAA and was given the option to use their bank. I really like the idea of having all my bills and money in one place so I decided to try it out. The people who helped me on the phone were very helpful and they spent a lot of time explaining anything I had a question about. Even if I had a basic banking question they answered it with care. They really treated me like I was important. The checking account I set up is very good. They have great protection for unauthorized charges. The checks they sent me are also really cool.

From the moment I first opened my account online, I knew USAA was the one for me. Their online application process, easy and intuitive interface, and quick approvals made it pretty much a no-brainer to get started. And I'm very glad I did.  Any issues that you experience either on your statement or with the service itself can be handled right away, even if you just have a common question, by using the drop down box on any page in your account and have the option of letting them call you. What an amazing feature!  It's not just the customer service portion of USAA that makes it excel though. The bank account clears transfers and checks faster than any bank I have ever been a member of. This speed has saved me both time and money.  If there would be one negative, and it's a small one, when I first started with USAA they offered cash back on credit transactions using your debit card, and unfortunately that had to be done away with. But you still get free checking, and free ATM withdrawals, and those things are just a few of the reasons why USAA is the right choice for me.

I love USAA! We have been banking with them since 2005 and I have never had a bad experience. Every time I have had to call them about something the person I have talked to has been so nice and helpful. I can't think of any other company I can say that about. They don't have any crazy fees and it is easy to access and bank online. I would never want to bank anywhere else. When I meet another Military family who is not signed up with USAA I tell them to go do it quickly. They will not be disappointed. I also like that USAA pays us a day early. That is so nice. I also love that all the fees you are charged going to other ATMs get refunded back to us. They are truly a great and honest company.

I transferred to USAA about 2 years ago from a well-known bank and I haven't looked back since. They continually offer the best deals when it comes to credit card interest rates, car loans, car insurance, CD interest rates, and the list goes on. I handle all of my finances through USAA now and it couldn't be any easier. I bought a car with a car loan through USAA, and bought car insurance all within about 2 days of each other. Everything was quick and easy.  USAA Customer Service department is top notch, as well. Wait times are short and problems get fixed as soon as possible. I had some questions about my car loan and they walked me through everything I needed to know within minutes. If you haven't switched to USAA yet, look into it!

I grew up an army brat, so USAA is the first bank I ever did business with and I'm still with them today. They take care of most of my banking now, as well as my renter's insurance and auto insurance. I've been very pleased with everything they've done for me. The checking account is just the kind of basic account I need. There is no minimum balance, no requirement for withdrawals, or anything like that. They make it super easy to deposit checks with them. Now, I can just take a couple of pictures of the check on my phone, and the money is available immediately most of the time. They've never wronged me, so I'm going to continue doing business with them. If you can, I suggest you do the same!

I have been banking with USAA since I was old enough to have my own bank account, and I had a trustee account in my parent's name before then. I also have a credit card and a car insurance policy with them. I cannot say enough about the level of customer service that USAA provides. I don't currently have the kind of assets that demand a high level of concern over competitive interest rates and the like, so I can't comment on that aspect of their business. However, it is wonderful to be able to know that whenever I need assistance (I have called well outside normal business hours) I will be able to speak to a helpful human being who has the knowledge to answer my problems and does so in a clear and competent manner. Most of the problems that I have had to contact USAA about have been issues on my end regarding cashing checks and ATM withdrawals and the like and I never got the impression that the representative wasn't more than willing to explain everything to me until I fully understood. Just knowing that I can rely on my bank to always do the right thing and that any issues that I might have will work them out in the way that they should is great. Not many banks attract the level of customer loyalty and satisfaction that USAA does and it is well deserved.

My husband and I have been with USAA since he joined the Army and this was our first credit card. We got it to help build credit and have been hooked ever since! We have an excellent interest rate and always have loved the ease of bill pay directly from out checking account. We missed a payment once and I immediately called USAA when I realized I'd forgotten to pay and they were very understanding and waived the late fee and didn't increase our interest rate which surprised me, I was thrilled! When my husband was deployed and I had a family emergency and needed to fly home USAA kindly lowered our interest rate and that helped us be able to pay off our balance quickly. I also love the rewards program, I love to take photos and through the rewards program I earned a free digital camera! This is still by far to this day my favorite credit card and I would recommend it to anyone with military background.

I have been banking with USAA since I was old enough to have my own bank account. They hold my car insurance policy as well. I have never been anything less than extremely impressed with the level of customer service and support that they provide. They offered me a credit (albeit with a very low limit) when I had no credit to speak of and was being denied by  a couple other companies. Their online BillPay process is foolproof and it's easy to keep track of statements and what is due each month. There have been a few cases where I have had questions about my statements and payments and it was extremely easy to speak to a real person who clearly explained my questions. Their reward program, although somewhat limited in terms of redeemable options, is simple and painfree. I've gotten the cash reward every time and the approval has been quick and applied to my statement within 48 hours. The only reason I would ever switch to a different credit card would be if I needed specific rewards that USAA didn't offer, but I don't see that happening anytime soon.

USAA is a fantastic bank and I have always had great and quick customer service when I call with a problem. I had a new branch located near me when I lived by a military base, but now that we are no longer close to the base I have no way to deposit checks, or get money orders if I need to, unless I do so by mail. The only problem I have ever had with this bank is the difficulty that you only once in a while run into when you don’t have an actual bank. Everything they have online works wonderfully.

USAA its self is an amazing bank, and I trust them completely for all my banking needs! This not only includes my debit account, savings, and insurance; but my investment options and credit card too. They are amazing! Problems are promptly fixed with a friendly phone call. If I over draft or am going to be late for a payment, I just have to explain my situation and they are always willing to help me. The online services are easy to use, and it is very easy to explore all the options that USAA offers. I have earned enough points on my credit card for about $300 cash back, which is nice to have for Christmas! I definitely look forward to banking with USAA for years to come.

I have been using USAA for quite some time, and I tried to apply for a credit card a few years back, but did not get approved.  I think it's pretty difficult to get credit with their bank.  You need to have great credit.    Now that I do have great credit after years of repairing, I finally got approved for an USAA American Express.  I love the rewards, and I earn money back all the time.  I like that I can choose to redeem the points I earn towards gift cards, or just put the money back on my card.  I recommend this card and bank to anyone that is looking for a great credit card.

I have been a member of USAA Bank since my husband joined the Army in 2006. We have always had a good experience with the customer service and quick response time. In 2011 we decided to buy a house, but my husband was currently deployed and stationed overseas. We worked with USAA and their mortgage team to help us get the house under contract and got the appraisal finalized (which fell through at one point) to get everything situated. We got approved for our loan and went out and bought the house of our dreams (well my dreams since my husband hadn't seen it yet!) and they helped us through the entire process. I was told to send in what paperwork when I needed to, and they were extremely helpful and diligent. I was extremely happy with their service and would recommend it to my friends!

Until I graduated from college, I only had one bank. It was a local credit union. They were great for all of my banking needs. Then I moved away from home. This started my hunt for a new bank. I researched a ton. I kept getting pointed back to USAA. Signing up was very simple. I was able to link to my old bank account very easily. They made my transition so much better. Any time that I call customer service I always get connected with a real person very quickly. Their customer service is amazing. They seem to genuinely care about helping you. My favorite feature is the online check depositing. I really love not having to drive to a bank in order to deposit a check.

What an outstanding place to do business! I've been a member of USAA since 1996 and I've never regretted it. USAA, while it is a bank, reminds me of a credit union. They've treated my family like we mean something and they've done so since I've been a member. One of the many examples that I can share is when I was a victim of debit card theft. Someone got a hold of my card number a year or so ago and was able to charge 150 before I noticed it. I immediately called USAA and was sent to the loss department. My money was refunded within the day and I received a new card in the mail a few days later. I love USAA and I highly recommend it to anyone who can become a member!

USAA bank has been a great asset to have. As a veteran I was told about USAA by a fellow soldier when I was looking to buy a new car. USAA has lower rates, better customer service, and overall just a better experience than I could have expected anywhere else. I also use USAA for my car insurance. Although there are not many offices in my area, I was able to get into an office and get the appropriate paperwork signed when I needed to. The staff was very nice and considerate. Any veteran should seriously consider using USAA for any financial loan or account.

USAA is by far the best bank I've ever used. All their services are top notch, but most importantly, their customer service is AMAZING. Their reps are always very friendly and very helpful no matter what you need. If you overdraft on accident, usually a quick call and they will help you out and take it off your statement. They process transactions very quickly and even have a service available where you can take a picture of your check and they'll process it for you via an app. It's really easy to add accounts if you need to transfer money and I get paid a day early because I use USAA.

I've been with USAA for 6 years.  USAA's service has always been amazing, and I couldn't ask for a more cooperative group.  That said, I am unfortunately less than impressed by this particular credit card.  The rewards are quite lackluster compared to similar offerings.  Since I don't fly or stay in hotels very often, American Express is not exactly the best card for my situation.  Again, on the other hand, there is no fee, and approval was easy.  I am very pleased to have this card with USAA and not any other company.  It truly makes having this card more worth it.  Overall, I appreciate the card, but I wish I had a different one.

USAA is the only place I will ever have a credit card. After going through a lot of life changes, divorce, moving and the like I was very flustered and unsure about a lot of things. I got this card and a lot of other services from USAA. The rewards are great, the interest rates are decent, but what sets USAA's card apart is the customer service. A live person every time I call, pleasant people who really want to help resolve any issues you have. They have a customer for life in me with this card. Thank you USAA!

I've been using my USAA credit card for about 5 years. Their online services are excellent. You can pay bills, deposit checks, order more checks, redeem rewards all online. The login is fairly simple. You only have to remember one password and your pin number (which is the same has your ATM pin number if you have a checking account). It's so simple!  Their online services also provide money management tools that help you track your spending and categorize charges. For those who use Mint.com, USAA hooks in very easily, and you can use Mint to aggregate your accounts.  Since I've had the card, I've redeemed 20,000 points for $200 deposited directly into my bank account. No issues whatsoever. The only downside is that you have to save up 20,000 points to get a 1% cash back. Typically, the giftcards redeem at <1% too. I probably won't redeem for anything less than 20,000 points.   I believe other companies give a slightly better reward, but USAA's service is not matched. USAA service are all (from my experience) fluent-English speaking Americans. In this day and age, that's not something to be taken for granted.  USAA is also one of the few banks/credit companies that are fiscally responsible.

USAA is the absolute best bank I've ever used.  I never have any surprises on my statements, any time I call them I am able to reach a person who knows what they're doing, and the online banking is a clean, easy interface.    The only downside is that there isn't a branch in my town.  The upside is that USAA provides free mail in deposits which are postage free.  They also refund atm charges every month, so I can use whatever banks' atm I want without worry.  I've had other banks cause problems with my accounts that take weeks of calling to resolve, which has made me a bit paranoid.  Any time I see something with my USAA account that I have questions about, I can call them, get put in touch with a person, and get a competent, complete explanation for what is going on (and if there is a problem, a fix) in just a few minutes.    I cannot recommend this place enough.  Unless they drastically change their business model, I don't think I'll ever change banks again.

I love my USAA card. Not only are the rewards fantastic, the customer support is absolutely stellar and I never have any issues getting questions I have answered. I was late on a payment a few months back and USAA was kind enough to waive it for me without a second though. I'd highly recommend this card, and USAA in general. The interest rates are okay, you'll be able to find some others that are lower, but for the quality of the organization and overall performance and customer service, you won't find a better card.

USAA is by far the most convenient, best banking experience I've every had. They process transactions quickly, and have a wonderful customer service team that genuinely cares, especially when you're going through something as chaotic as a divorce.   Even though their branches are all located out of state, the options available for quick, convenient deposit are amazing!  They have the standard smartphone app, which lets you deposit your check by taking a digital image, eliminating the need to mail it to them.  More impressive, though, is Easy Deposit at the UPS store.  Should your phone be dead, or out of cell tower range, you bring your check into one of 19,000 locations all over the country, swipe your debit card, and hand over your check to be scanned.  The money is available with very little delay, and you get the original document back for your records.  If you ever need to transfer money to or from other accounts, the bank allows you to link multiple external accounts to your USAA checking/saving account, and doesn't charge a fee to send or receive money.    Great, no fee checking account, awesome service, and convenient banking.  What more can I say?

I have been very happy with USAA’s service. I have had this card for several years and have steadily expanded my line of credit by paying my bills on time. The rate is very reasonable and the customer service is fantastic. I had some suspicious charges  originating overseas and was notified immediately by their fraud protection team. Nothing was charged to me and I had a replacement card in the mail within a week. Their website is easy to follow and has a nice breakdown of your purchasing habits and other useful information. Finally, their rewards system can be used to apply discounts to consumer items through a number of vendors, or simply get cash back, which I prefer. The rewards system on their webpage does take a little time to get used to and navigate, but once you get used to it, it is seamless.

I have been with USAA for about 4 years and have loved every moment of it. I have multiple USAA accounts including their American Express card. Logging onto their dashboard online to make payments is quick, easy, and painless. There is no hassle and the statements are all delivered electronically. If for any reason I have had to contact customer care concerning the credit card, I have been met with some of the nicest most caring customer care representatives that I have ever had the pleasure of speaking with. I would highly recommend this card to anyone looking for accessible payment options, low rates, and amazing customer support.

Amazing credit card, which is hard to come by these days. Low rates, no issues ever and awesome customer service. It even came with 6 free months of CreditCheck Monitoring so I can keep an eye on what my scores are up to. Usaa is the best bank out there for every service that a service member or veteran could need; I recommend them to every new guy I get in the Company because of the personal care that is taken with your plans in life. Bottom line is you can't beat Usaa on rates, service or willingness to help in any situation.

USAA's credit card is the best I have ever had. I have never had any problems with it in the 6 years I have had it. USAA's customer service is top-notch, and their fraud protection services are superb. I have had two fraud scares on my card, and USAA was quick not only to alert me of the suspicious activities, but also refund all the fraudulent charges. In addition, USAA offers cash rewards for every dollar spent on the credit card, meaning that I can get money back just by paying my regular bills with the card. The interest rates are reasonable, and as long as you pay it off by the due date, you will never see it anyway.

I have been a member of USAA for 16 years and have a used a multitude of their products(mortgages, loans, bank accounts, insurance, etc.) and all of there products have been top rate.  With that said I have to say that there American express card leaves something to be desired.  Don't get me wrong it does everything that it should like no fee's, decent interest rate, the ability to carry a balance and top notch customer service that comes with all USAA products.  Where it fails is in its reward offering which is currently.45%.  With a little searching it would not be hard to find a American Express offering that offers way more value in terms of rewards in either cash back or miles/points.  So I would say unless you are like me and value having all your products under one house and are a loyal USAA costumer I would say you can find more bang for you buck elsewhere.

It's the best.  I've had a few cards, and this is by far the best.  The rate is always low, there's no annual or hidden fees, and the rewards are pretty good.  The ones I've had for other rewards like airline miles aren't very good.  With USAA, I got a TV and a netbook so far.  A nd their customer service has always been outstanding.

I have had a lot of credit cards, but none have been better than my USAA card. My rate is very low compared to other offers I am constantly being mailed. I have all of my financial and insurance needs handled through USAA, and have never had any issues. Any time I have needed to contact their customer support I have reached a representative in a timely manner. The representatives are very friendly and knowledgeable.   Their fraud prevention teams contacted me very quickly after seeing some "red flag" transactions made at onilne companies from other states/countries. I explained all the charges were legitimate and my card was reactivated immediately. Any other time I have had a card disabled due to potential fraud, it was left up to me to notice. Usually as I was trying to use the card.   USAA will have my business for as long as I have financial or insurance needs.

The USAA World Mastercard is my go-to card for almost all my purchases. USAA's customer service is fantastic and they really do keep an eye on your credit card charges and alert you to any suspicious activity. I did have that exact problem about a year ago, when someone used my card number to purchase several items online from a different city than my own. USAA called me and asked if the charges were authorized. When I expressed my surprise at the charges, they removed them from my account immediately and sent me a new card the very next day! You can't beat service like that! The card's interest rate is reasonable and the company has proven itself a winner in a sea of credit card companies that are only out to make a buck. I'd definitely recommend this card to anyone in the market for a Mastercard.

I have had the USAA Credit Card for around 3 years now.  I have never had any issues with being able to use the card anywhere.  It is a bit tough to get this card though.  Interest rates are resonable for a credit card.  Have never had any errors on my bill or anything like that.  There is a rewards program with this card, and you get 1 point for every dollar spent.  There are a bunch of different items you can get with your points, from gift cards, to electronics, to housewares.  Anytime I had to call Customer Service about the credit card, the operators are very courtious and helpful.  Overall I would recommend this card to anyone that has membership to USAA.  USAA is for current, prior or retired military and their families.

I have all my accounts with USAA and am extremely happy with the company as a whole. I've had my credit card with them for over a year. They have outstanding credit offers, some I don't always take advantage of. They are on top of my accounts and have frozen my card on an occasion when suspected activity was happening. They call me to confirm and take action from there.  You have every option to check balances and can check balance 24 hours a day.  I'm an extremely loyal customer to USAA and have absolutely no complaints with them.

I have had the USAA card for about 6 months, and I couldn't be happier with it.  The customer service at USAA is the best I have ever experienced, and despite the fact that I banked at Bank of America for many years, the great customer service I have experienced at USAA lead me to move my bank accounts to USAA.    A few months ago, I accidentally left my USAA credit card at a casino ATM, and when I realized that the next day, I called USAA.  As usual,  I reached a human right away, and she reported my card stolen, but not before telling me that someone had taken $500 out.  It seems that the PIN I used is one of the most popular ones, and among the first three that thieves try when they steal  a card.  USAA immediately credited the $500 back to my credit card, while they investigated, and just a month later informed me that they had no results from their investigation, but that they would not deduct the $500 from my account.  What other bank would be that kind to their cutomers?  I had gotten so used to being nickle-and-dimed and it is truly a pleasure to be a customer of USAA.

I love my bank! They make it so easy for me to do anything I need to do.  I can pay my bills easily and deposit checks easily from my smart phone.  They make my funds available immediately when I do any mobile banking, including transfers, and deposits.  They also have my car insurance and my car loan and I also love that my bank was not involved in any of the high risk investments that caused our current economic climate.  I LOVE THESE GUYS! I can feel safe in the fact that my money is protected and secure and they do not make me jump through any hoops to get my money after I deposit it.  I have been a member since before I can remember, I think my parents made opened my savings account with USAA when I was about 10 or 12 and have been with them ever since. I will never leave this bank! They are the only bank around that I can say that about.  I honestly feel bad for those people who bank with Chase or Bank of America because of all the fees and how long they hold your funds even when they are direct deposits.

I have been with USAA for around five years now and I have absolutely nothing but smooth sailing with them. The fact that I do not have to worry about using an ATM and incurring any ridiculous charges is something that I love. Like most other banks USAA also has a cell phone application that allows me to check my balance, access my proof of auto insurance or even file a claim without needing to be near a computer. USAA has made banking an incredibly easy process with more features than I can count that include a tracker that keeps records of how much money per month is spent on what goods and services as well as multiple options for those who wish to invest money. In conclusion, I cannot imagine using any other bank after the amazing experience I have had with USAA.

My USAA checking account has been the best experience I could ask for.  I can use any ATM and be reimbursed up to 15$ in ATM fees per month.  I always get my direct deposit credited to my account an entire day before everyone else at my company gets theirs.  When I do have a paper check I just take it to a UPS store and have them deposit it with only my debit card.  I highly recommend USAA to all my friends.  I don't feel as if they are taking advantage of me as many banks do.  Plus, as far as I know, you don't need to be in the military to receive USAA free checking.  Only for USAA insurance do you require military affiliation.

USAA is without a doubt a great bank.  Excellent customer service for all of the questions that I've had about my checking account, and a great online page that lets me do everything I need without ever having to actually go into a bank.  The only problem that I've ever had is that it's mostly for military persons and their family members, so if you aren't one of those, than it's difficult to get accepted, but once you're in, then you've got a great bank for life.  Definitely a great bank, and I would recommend to anyone who can use it!

I recently started banking with USAA. I really like the ability to deposit a check at the UPS store. I rarely get paper checks these days, but it is nice to have that and they usually have a quick turn around. The only thing that I would really like is to see more USAA ATMs that accept cash. If I have a large amount of cash, I need to detour quite a bit out of my way to deposit it.   They also made the transition between changing from my maiden name to married name painless. I received checks as gifts made out to my new husband and I, my maiden name, and my married name. After a quick call to customer service, it was resolved and I could deposit my gift checks without worry at the UPS store.

USAA has offered me the best banking services I've ever had. I was fortunate enough to get an account with them due to my father being in the military and they have offered me the best services. When I opened the account, I set it all up online and it was done so quickly and without any problems. I was even contacted by USAA regarding my car insurance and renter's insurance. They did a brief questionnaire with me and offered me a package for both that was cheaper than what I was paying for car insurance alone. They even helped me set up a savings plan so that I could purchase a house when I was ready. I also really appreciated that I actually was getting a higher interest rate than I had ever found on any other savings account. I loved it. I would recommend that anybody who can get an account with them get one.

I really love USAA as a company and they provide outstanding service.   The customer service is excellent and always reliable.  They have a useful website that I use to keep track of everything on the card and to pay the bill out of my checking account.  Great options for getting only electronic statements, paper mail, or both.  The cash rewards program is one of the most generous around.  The system they use for security works great, since two different times in five years there was suspicious activity on my account, they flagged it immediately, called me, and instantly sorted it out so my account was protected. And all this for no annual fee. This is my go-to card for daily use.

This has been a great card, I have been using it for at least six years now and have had zero complaints. I've had no problems that were not my fault, I forgot to notify them that I was traveling across country so they locked the card to protect me in case it was not me, my bad! After they called me to check whether I was using my card or not they had the hold lifted with in the hour. USAA has some of the best customer service I have ever seen. I have been, and will continue to be, very happy that I was able to qualify for joining USAA thanks to my father's service.

I have been a member for about a year now and they have really helped me with finding the right savings account that would give me the best interest on my money. Every time I call, the customer service is always excellent. I am in the market of buying a house and they were more than happy to help go through the financing process.Their process was quick and very painless. I feel this is a great bank and I am sure I will be a customer for years to come. My father was a member for the last 40 years and I can understand why.

USAA has been my bank for about 5 years now. Let me tell you that there is no better bank I have come across to date. No matter when I call or what I call them about, they always have a friendly and helpful staff member helping me in just a few minutes. I have several accounts with USAA, from checking to a money market account and even car insurance, and it seems like every time I get a new account I am pleasantly surprised that their level of expertise in that area, especially with the money market account. Although this bank is a bit exclusive, I can tell you that becoming a member of this small(er) bank would be truly rewarding.

USAA has been my auto insurance provider since I have been driving and I have never been disappointed with their service so when I found out about their bank it was a no-brainer that I would want to utilize their services.  They have fantastic customer service, great rates and make it super easy to bank from a distance!  They refund all ATM fees for up to 10 transactions a month and take deposits at any UPS Store! In addition, if you have a line of credit with them you can actually take a picture of your check with your phone and deposit it that way.  In addition to the great checking/savings accounts USAA also provides investing advice for no cost.  I would recommend this bank to anyone (and unlike the insurance which is limited to military and their family banking is open to everyone!)

USAA is a great service. I never have to worry about ATM fees and I can go to any ATM. It can be annoying that they don't have a physical location, but I haven't had a problem with that yet. In fact, the access locations they do have are pretty impressive. All in all, great service.

As active duty military we are completely pleased with our service at USAA.  We started off with a loan checking account and have since invested, added a savings account, and car and home insurance with them.  One thing we love about our checking account is the monthly reimbursement of ATM fees.  And it's great to have car insurance that is reasonably priced.  When we were in a fender bender USAA thoroughly investigated the issue, before realizing that it was a set up, and we were no rougher for the wear on our insurance payments.  Customer Service has always been understanding and quick to resolve any issue we've had with strange charges to our account and with changing out home policy to solely renter's insurance when we moved.

I am extremely happy with USAA as my primary bank.  While I also use them for my auto and home insurance, their checking account is what really sets them apart.  ATM fees are covered and there is a small percentage that you receive as interest every month, among other perks.  Customer service is always great and always a native English speaker in my experience, which is helpful.  Perhaps the biggest draw, however, is their Deposit@Home feature, which lets you scan checks at home on your office scanner of cell phone.  It's really easy and convenient and saves me from making a trip to a local bank.  It's by far the most valuable of all the services I get from USAA.  The one negative, however, is that you must have some sort of loan account with them to qualify to scan checks.  I set up my mortgage through them, but I also could have taken out a loan or credit card to qualify.  It's an annoyance that one must do so much to qualify for such a great feature, but the payoff is worth it.  Overall, I rank USAA as the best bank I've ever worked with.

I have banked with USAA for almost 30 yrs and have always been pleased with their customer service and the way they bend over backward to make sure I get what I need quickly and easily. I can do almost any action from the website day or night which saves so much time.  All 3 of my children bank with USAA and I know they are well cared for as well because I could monitor all their accounts if needed.  They make it easy to transition kids to their own personal accounts as they become adults and none of my kids have changed to a different bank since they moved away.  I trust USAA and have never had a discrepancy in my finances turn out to be their fault. They are also very good at fixing discrepancies by working with the person/organization that made the mistake.  I have only one complaint. If you have to file bankruptcy, they lock you out of the main website and you have to call the bank to ask someone to do things for you which wastes time and uses their resources very poorly.

My husband and I have been using USAA for about a year now.  We switched over from Wells Fargo when he joined the Army.  I have had nothing but positive experiences with USAA. I love the fact that they donâ€™t charge a monthly fee to have a checking account like all other banks do.  Their customer service is really respectable too.  They are fast, prompt, and actually care about the things you are saying. I would say that the only down side we would be the lack of branches they have, but you can use any ATM and they will reimburse you for the fees they charge. I am so glad we joined USAA and I would never go anywhere else.

I am current USAA member and have been for several years.  Each time I call with a question the customer service department has given me an answer within minutes.  I am very appreciative to those who work hard to make sure that my families' accounts are well taken care of and accessible from any ATM for free.  I love the fact that at the end of each month I get all ATM fees refunded because as a member of USAA I do not have to pay to access my money.  Thank you so much for the easy internet and phone access allowing me peace of mind and comfort about accessing the information I need!

I have only had positive experiences with USAA. I have been with them for 8 years now, and it has been great working with them.  The only downside is that they do not have local offices. However, they make up for that with many services. I appreciate being able to deposit checks via my iPhone, and they do refund ATM fees, since they do not have ATMs of their own.   Anytime I have had to call in for assistance, they have been very helpful and courteous.  If you have the ability to bank with USAA, I highly recommend doing so!

I have been with USAA for over 10 years now.  Their customer service is far superior to any other bank; however, I do feel that it has declined compared to how it was when I first became a customer.  It really can be hit or miss when calling in (you tend to get a really helpful or a really disgruntled customer service representative).    I have applied for credit cards and loans both online and over the phone, and it has always been an easy, quick, painless process.  I love how technology-oriented their services are, and I regularly deposit checks with the mobile deposit feature through my iPhone.  My father-in-law sends money orders to us, and, while I am not able to deposit them via phone or scanner, I like that I can go to most UPS Store locations to deposit them there.  I feel that USAA has really made so many steps to be as accessible as a "regular" bank that it's as convenient, if not more convenient, to bank with them as if I were to go to a local bank.

USAA Federal Savings Bank is, like the rest of USAA, a great entity to do business with. They have friendly customer service, and great problem resolution. I've used their checking and savings products for about seven years now.   This is an online bank, so there are no branches (at least in NC where I live). That said depositing a check is still easy, as you can scan an image of the check to deposit it. Cash deposits are not an option. Withdrawal is facilitated by free ATM withdrawals (up to a higher limit per month than I've used except for one time) and they reimburse you for fees the other bank charges you up to the first 10, I believe.  I use this account for direct deposit, and on one occasion the money didn't show up when expected and I was able to find out very quickly, with the help of one of their support staff, that the money had been transferred a day late by my employer. I've used them as an insurer as well and the experiences with support staff have always been by native English speakers who are polite, helpful, and effective.   Their free checking is, *gasp*, FREE. No monthly fee, no minimum balance. I had 75 cents for six months once with never a peep from the bank. Online tools to manage your account are plentiful and it even comes with FREE online bill-pay. So if you qualify, you're a fool not signup. It costs nothing, and requires nothing from you to keep it active.  The application process limits membership to people in the military, retired military, and their direct families. So not everyone can join, but if you qualify they are the very best. It's not quite as perfect as it used to be (they used to have 24/7 call centers for even the bank, but now it is slightly more limited) but it is still an amazing deal for the price, which again is FREE.  The savings accounts are just as easy to use, though all I ever did with mine was take direct deposits and transfer to checking as needed. No hassles, no fees.

I have been a USAA cardholder for just over a year, however I have experienced the great customer service that people have known to love from USAA for the past 12 years of my life.   Since USAA was my first bank, it was a no brainier to have USAA be my first credit card company as well. The application process was simple and within 3 days I had my new card, with a large limit.  The rewards are good, I receive a yearly bonus based on how much I spend/how much I paid off.  One thing I love about USAA is the customer service, if at any time you have the slightest issue they are always willing to take the steps to make it right. Just a few months ago my credit card was over charged 12 times at a Braves game, basically what happened was every time they tried to refund me for the over charging, they ended up charging me again. It was an absolute nightmare. The only way I could safely get through the situation was to have USAA put a cancel on the current card and mail me a new one. Because of my frustrations they overnight-ed me a new credit card for free as well as crediting my account with the refund that the stadium concessions should have given me.   My only complaint is that the interest rate is a tad high, but I never miss a payment so it doesn't really effect me. I would rather have a high interest rate with a company I trust then with one that I don't.  The rewards from this card might not be the best, ever since they did away with the points store I have found that I get rewarded less, but it's not a deal breaker because while this isn't the best rewards based on the web but this is a reliable company that truly cares for their users. The site is quick, easy to use and they even have iPhone/iPad apps that let you pay your bills or view your balance.

I love USAA but overall I am disappointed by their American Express card.  The Pros: It's one of the few ways to get an American Express card without going directly through American Express.  No annual fee.  The concierge service, the included extended warranties and insurance and overall consumer protection provided by American Express can not be beat by any other no fee credit card offered by Visa or MasterCard.  The Cons: The reward program is horrible. There are many other no-fee credit card offerings that give better cash back rewards and if you use the card often there are many other American Express offerings that work out to be a better deal, even if there is an annual fee.  Sometimes USAA delays credits to my account even when paying directly from my USAA checking.  Overall it's an ok card. If you really want an American Express card but don't plan to use it a lot it's not a bad choice. If you plan to use the card often and want to maximize your cash back rewards, look elsewhere.

My husband and I have been customers of this bank since he joined the army in '05. We have checking, savings and our auto loan and insurance through them.  They are always very helpful, explain any and all changes to us, and are always extremely friendly.   I have recommended them to any and all family members, and since they recently opened a branch where my husband is stationed, it makes banking that much easier.  One of their best features is their iPhone app, which allows us to electronically deposit all checks we receive. It saves us the time and gas from going to the bank, and even the postage and time from sending it in to the Texas branch.  If you are military and don't have USAA, you need to switch over right away!!

I have been a banking customer for about 20 years.  Of that 20 years, I have been a member of USAA for about 5 years.  By far, this is the best bank I have ever had to deal with (and I used to work for a bank).  Each and every time I have had to call the bank for anything, I have been greeted by a friendly voice.  In addition, they really strive to satisfy their customers.  They have made suggestions that might help me financially, but have not been overly pushy. Their main goal is to serve military members and their families.  They excel at this!  I am proud that they appreciate not only my business, but my service.  Because of that, I really appreciate the service that they give me!  Thanks, USAA, for being such a great bank!

I have been with USAA for over 3 years since joining the military and to this point I don't have a single bad thing to say about them!  I have had nothing but the best customer service and overall experience in every aspect, but I really want to point out my experience with my USAA credit card.  I had my identity stolen and someone used my credit card without my consent, racking up huge charges on the card.  I reported this to USAA and their customer service department were very quick about closing my account, and getting my money back to me with little inconvenience!

USAA is the greatest bank I have ever dealt with. They are a military bank and you can only bank with them if you have some affiliation with the military or government however, once a member always a member. My ex husband was in the Army and even though we've been divorced for almost 10 years I'm still with USAA and we couldn't be happier. Their customer service is beyond anything I've experienced anywhere else. I'm never on hold for long if I call with an issue or a question, everyone I speak with is cheerful and I really do get the feeling that they want to help me. USAA has truly free checking with no minimum balance, interest earned on your checking account and because they have no local branches in most states they have no ATM fees AND they will refund whatever the owner of the ATM charges you. I'm very pleased with their credit card services as well as their insurance and investment services. All in all, they are wonderful. Incredibly helpful and always looking out for the customer. Five stars all the way!!!!

I have been using USAA for a few years now and I must say that I love my bank.  They have amazing customer service, great rates, free ATM deposits, and make banking easy.  I gave up my national chain bank for USAA because of the free checking USAA offer.  Transferring money in and out of the checking account is very easy.  They seem to really care about me and want my business.  I suggest USAA to anyone who is able to join the bank.  The only downside is that it is not open to the public, you must have family who meet qualifications to join.

I have been banking with USAA for over 12 years now and it has been a wonderful experience. A lot of my friends don't understand how I can bank with USAA because they don't have any physical branches but I have never had the need to go into a bank in the last 12 years and I think about all the time and energy that has saved me. USAA has great customer service and always treats me with the utmost care and attention detail.  I have a checking account, savings account, car insurance and renters insurance through them and they always make sure I am getting the best rate.  The provide me with free checks as well as free deposit slips and they even have an great iOS iPhone/iPad app that lets you deposit checks if you don't want to mail them in. Simply put i've had no issues with USAA in over 12 years and I will continue banking with them for as long as I can.

The USAA MasterCard has been a staple of mine for over 12 years.  I have been banking with USAA since the mid 1990’s and I have been completely satisfied.  The application process for this card was simple and I was approved quickly.  Their rates are competitive and even though I do not take advantage of their points program I am sure many others would find it beneficial.   Being able to keep track of my balance, outstanding charges and then pay the monthly bill through their online account management service is very easy.   Should I have any questions or problems I can always contact them either via email or on the phone and get a prompt response.  Their customer service representatives are some of the most pleasant and helpful I have ever come across.  They noticed some strange activity on my account one time and immediately informed me.  Through their diligence a major financial catastrophe was avoided.  I was extremely grateful.

This USAA American Express credit card is the only American Express card I own.  It allows me to pay off the entire balance every month or carry a balance.  The rewards program is something that could be improved on though.  Currently, it only offers.45% for the first $5,000 spent every year.  Since I don't come close to spending that much money on this card, the rewards are usually pretty small.  Also, this card only allows you to redeem the cash you've earned in January instead of offering you a choice as to when you can redeem what you've earned for cash.

I have been really happy with USAA as my primary bank account for savings and checking.  I have had a USAA savings account for two years and have been using it as my primary checking and savings for about one year.  I have found the website really easy to use and have had success depositing checks using my phone and at UPS stores.  Withdrawals are easy from any ATM because USAA refunds you ATM charges; they do this once a month so make sure you don't overdraw your account on this one though.  I like that I don't have to look for "my" ATM but can use any one around, even if it's a little bit of a pricey fee, because I'll get paid back no matter what.  Using the online tools to manage my money and transfer between accounts has been very easy.  There's certain aspects of the website interface that aren't super intuitive, but everything is there if you're willing to click around a little bit.  The website is very fast and I can see up to the minute info about my accounts, which is great. Overall I've been really happy with USAA.

I have been a proud member of USAA for 2 years and I strongly recommend everyone to join. The great thing about USAA is they offer competitive rates and online convenience but they also have great customer service. The few times I have had to call them I've quickly been connected to a real person in Texas who was always courteous and able to solve my problems.   Other things worth knowing: The checking is totally free and they offer free checks and you are able to deposit checks via smart phone.   Membership is now easier to obtain than ever. Even non military members can join now.  They are one of the few banks who offer American Express branded cards.  I am so happy I switched to USAA!

I have been a USAA customer for years but only recently have I become a checking account holder for USAA. In comparison with other banks they have fantastic customer service, however, everything is done over the phone or online. If you want to deposit a check you have to go to a UPS express store that does check deposits for USAA. This is very inconvenient. It is this fact that would have me recommend to anyone thinking about getting an account with USAA to also have a secondary checking account with another bank as I do. This way if you get a check that needs to be deposited you can deposit it into your other bank account and transfer your money electronically. Other then the lack of full service banking locations I feel that USAA is a great bank. Highly recommended.

I have been a happy and proud USAA MasterCard holder for nearly ten years now. The USAA MasterCard has superior customer service, easy online account management tools, and has an outstanding customer rewards program. I had an unauthorized charge on my account from an overseas business. USAA promptly helped me resolve this issue and gave me confidence that any future unauthorized charges will be handled with the same high degree of professional customer service.   Since I became disabled, I have to rely on a dependable card for my bills and for the bulk of my grocery shopping because I cannot leave my house. I only trust USAA MasterCard with that responsibility. My USAA MasterCard helps me to live independently and without fear of identity theft.

USAA is a great company to work with.  They have EXCELLENT customer service.  Any problem I have ever had the customer service people have been able to help me out quickly and efficiently.  When I signed up, I did so for USAA Free Checking.  There has not been any kind of a maintenance fee or any other fee associated with the account.  It truly is FREE.  Online banking with USAA has also been flawless.  There has never been a missed payment or an erroneous payment.  Overall USAA has met all my needs and has exceeded my expectations in banking.  Would definitely recommend checking out USAA if you are eligible for membership.

When I first signed up for USAA, I thought they were a great bank option for me. The checking account was completely free, which was very convenient for me, because Iâm a college student and I donât have a job right now, so my income is pretty sporadic and a monthly bank fee is a big inconvenience for me. They offered online banking, which was very convenient for me.   The application process was simple and they were willing to send free checks. I thought this was a great offer, so I signed up and transferred 25 dollars into the account. The first problem was that Ally wouldnât let me transfer from my other bank account, so I had to do some sort of cash advance thing, which cost me an extra 25 dollars. If I had known that in advance, I would have chosen another bank. Then USAA froze my access to my online account. I called and they told me to send in all of these verification documents. I asked them if I could transfer my money out of the account then so that I could have access to it, while I worked on sending in the documents, but they said no. So I had no access to my money. I decided to just leave this bank alone entirely and lose the 25 dollars rather than deal with them.   I truly believe that these banks that allow online registration should have some way to verify identity in the application process instead of waiting until I've already registered and put money into the account to close it and request documents.

USAA is the epitome of how a bank should be. Every time I've gone to them, they've been very friendly and helpful. Setting up a checking account was very painless,  and their online banking interface is equally easy to use. The checking account I have with them reimburses me for ATM fees, which means I can always access my money, no matter where in the world I am. Not having branches used to be a bit inconvenient, but now I can deposit checks into my USAA account at UPS stores, which is almost more convenient than actually having bank branches. All in all, I have no regrets with using USAA as my primary checking bank. They're great!

I've had USAA for almost 10 years and they've been nothing but helpful.  While at times they can't provide a service for me that other banks will carry I still continue to bank with them because of their great customer service.  Unfortunately I regretfully have to keep a Bank of America checking for cash deposits.  If I were able to have this service through USAA, I would cancel them immediately, however my job deals with cash often and it necessitates a bank like this in conjunction with USAA.  If i were to give them a rating, it would be 9 our of 10 specifically for not having brick and mortar locations.

I have had USAA for over 10 years.  They are the best bank that I've ever used.  Their customer service is always above par and I have always gotten a helpful and courteous representative on the phone and in person.  I only wish that we had a USAA branch in Houston.  The good is, if you have a loan or auto or home policy with them, you are able to deposit checks via a scanner or your mobile phone.   I had a fraudulent charge on my checking account once.  Instead of having to wait while they performed an investigation, USAA automatically put the money back in my account, without any hassle or delays.  I also love that they deposit my military paycheck a day before I am supposed to receive it.  I have complete confidence in my bank and have also gotten my children bank accounts with them.

I am not sure if it is this exact card but it appears to be the closest facsimile. I have a USAA Platinum Cash Rewards MasterCard. I have a reasonable limit and have no complaints about the interest rate. I honestly have never paid any attention to what the rewards are or how they work so I can't say whether they're good or not. It has saved me in emergencies when I did not have the money to pay a bill and the payment stays low so I can afford to keep trying to pay it off. I have never had any problems with it or had any complaints so never even had to deal with customer service.

I have been using a USAA MasterCard for almost ten years and I would never consider switching to another card company. They have the best customer service of any card issuer that I have ever used. They quickly helped me resolve an unauthorized charge recently with absolutely no problems. USAA has a nice rewards program too. I am a home bound, disabled veteran and must rely on my USAA card for bills, on-line grocery shopping, and all my other living requirements. I will only trust USAA with this level of responsibility in my life.

I have been a USAA customer for three years now and they are by far the best bank I have ever had. This week I just had a friend of mine switch to them. Their customer service are always very helpful and professional. I have them for banking, insurance, credit monitoring and savings. Their mobile app is also very convenient and easy to navigate. I recommend them to all my military friends and family.

I love this bank. They are really good with the people that bank through them. I have everything except the mortgage on my home. They are always there to help me and can answer all of my questions. They are never rude even if they want to be and I know that I can be annoying. Someone stole my credit card when I was in the hospital after I had my first baby. They cleared it up with no problems and no issues afterwards!

I was with BOA for about a year before I started getting fed up with them. My brother-in-law and my sister, who are both active military, recommended that I open an account with USAA, since our father served and I would qualify for one. I closed my account with BOA, and the same day, opened one with USAA, and from that day, it has been nothing but smooth sailing! Where it would take BOA about 5-7 business days to clear an online transfer of funds, it takes USAA about 2-3. I am so impressed with their service, and plan on staying with them for the foreseeable future. I would recommend USAA over any bank in this country, hands down!

Iâve had numerous bank accounts in the past. Unfortunately, the majority of them have been nothing but major problems and headaches. Nowadays, banks like to charge for everything under the sun so to speak. My family banks with USAA Federal Savings. They talked me into opening an account with them, and to date I have been very happy and satisfied.   One of the things that I love is that they refund any charges from using ATM machines! They do so in a timely fashion. I also have their debit card and home insurance. Every time that I have needed assistance the customer service reps have always answered my questions promptly and accurately. Suffice it to say, I look forward to remaining a member USAA Federal Savings Bank for a long time to come.

USAA was once only for active duty military use. Now USAA is available to dependent and non-dependent family members. My husband's father was in the army and opened us an account after we got married. We have used USAA for over 20 years. USAA offers very competitive services and has been a good and sound bank throughout all the dips and highs in the economy. I feel safe with my money in USAA.   USAA responds quickly to customer needs. Last year we had a series of debits show up that were not ours. USAA did not question our claim and immediately replaced the funds. They were very efficient in setting up new account numbers and closing the compromised account. The wait time on each of the service calls was less than ten minutes for this incident. Online banking was offered several years ago, and I find this service very useful. I can deposit checks via computer with a scanner at home. This is quick and convenient.   The only thing keeping me from giving USAA five stars is the lack of local branches in most states. Most banking can be done online or electronically, but there are times when it is useful to have a brick and mortar bank for services. The quick and reliable service and the strong reputation of USAA make up for this most times. I will continue to use their services and believe that more banking will be available online in the future.

I feel like I have finally found a bank that is not run by blood sucking greedy jerks.  Account disclosures are clear, fees are reasonable, and the website is top-notch. I am very happy with USAA and would recommend them to anyone looking for a new bank. Non-military members do have slightly less products to choose from, such as not being able to take advantage of a lot of the mobile banking solutions like check picture deposits and the insurance products, but still there is a wide range of banking products available such as checking, savings, investments, loans, and credit cards. Overall I am very pleased with USAA.

I've had USAA's credit card for about 4 years now, as it was my first credit card when I was 18. I have also been a USAA member since I was younger, being in the military. When I had initially called USAA at 18, I was advised by both my mother and the USAA representative that opening a low limit credit card through USAA would help build my credit score, which is true. USAA is also very understanding and trustworthy, in my personal experience, the very first time I missed a payment when I came to college and it was during finals, and explained I had been super busy, they were so kind to waive the one fee. USAA also has a great interest rate on their cards, and they offer amazing customer service. I remember when I was on vacation far away from home, they called to make sure I was away and not that someone had stolen my card. USAA has always had great rates, and great customer service. They even have Deposit@Mobile so that you can deposit a check on the go and even pay the card from your mobile app. I would recommend them to anyone who can be a USAA member.

I started using USAA for our credit needs at the recommendation of my mother.  Something to jump start our credit history but alos a service we could trust.  She was right.  I have never had an issue with USAA services.  Any question I've ever had has gone unanswered whether I've used their online help or called and spoke to a rep.  The USAA rewards program is out of this world! My husband and I love it. We got an extremely low rate for a first time user and I was able to tie my bank account into the USAA system making payments super easy!

I have been with USAA for over 6 years and have loved their amazing service.  Their credit card is no exception.  The rates are super low in comparison to other cards.  Also, the rewards system will give you cash back right into your bank account.  My favourite feature is using the online system where I can transfer monies from one account to the card to pay off the balance.

Iâve been banking with USAA for nearly four years now and I really couldnât be happier. When I have had occasion to call, I have never been on hold for more than two minutes.  They also allow you to contact them via email which is extremely convenient for my schedule. They always respond to my emails within 24 hours. All representatives I have spoken to are cheerful and extremely helpful.   They give you all the information you need in clear, easy to understand language and are always willing to work with you.   USAA allows me to use any ATM without having to worry about a fee. Since they donât have any banks in my area this is an extremely important feature. Their website is user friendly and it has a lot of free resources to help manage your finances. They make it simple to transfer money between both USAA and non USAA bank accounts. Their smartphone application runs well and even allows you to take a picture of your check in order to deposit it instantly.   I use USAA for my credit cards, my banking and my auto and property insurance. There are very few companies that I trust, but USAA is one of them. Whenever there is an issue, I donât even bother to get upset - USAA always takes care of it.

USAA has to be the best bank that I have ever had the privilege to be a member of. Not only do they have great customer service - friendly representatives who go above and beyond to help maintain customer satisfaction, answer every question, and are always willing to help you with whatever you need - but they also have fantastic rates for interest on credit cards, on mutual funds, and other banking accounts. They are very user friendly - their online site is so well put together, and the mobile app even has Deposit@Mobile in case I am not near an ATM or have Direct Deposit. Many times I have called them for various reasons - to discuss my credit card payments (which the very first time I missed a payment in my freshman year of college they were so kind to waive the late fee for me), to open up a mutual fund, to report a card missing, etc; and I was always treated with respect and truly had a great overall customer experience.They are also very understanding and very helpful, when I had even the most trivial of questions such as how long a transfer would take or even a question such as what was the best option for opening my first IRA. USAA also has amazing auto insurance - one specific instance I remember is when my car broke down at the most inconvenient hour of the night, I was able to call the 24 hour roadside assistance hotline, and talked to a live representative with little to no wait, was called back when the tow truck was on the way with the estimated time and the name of the company, again when they were thirty minutes out, and called again to confirm they arrived. Which honestly, after that specific incident when my car broke down, I felt such gratitude for being a USAA member! I feel very lucky to be able to call USAA my bank as I am a military dependent, and am also happy to say that I will continue to be a USAA member for a very long time.

I have been with USAA for years and have honestly never had a bad experience. They are extremely easy to get a hold of and are very helpful. They are not pushy about selling other services and I have only been directly contacted about anything like that twice over the past six years. The online services are great and make up for the lack of having physical branches, I think. Checks and cash can be sent in easily. Checks can also be easily deposited at home with a scanner or cell phone, which is extremely convenient. My entire family has used USAA for years and, of all of them, I've only heard one complaint. Even that was quickly taken care of very professionally and quickly.   When dealing with cash deposits, it be slightly frustrating not being able to go to a physical back to deposit it. While, it is possible to mail in deposit, a person who frequently needs to deposit cash may be better off getting an additional bank account with a physical branch, as I did when I was a waitress needing to deposit tips. I do believe that USAA is beginning to install ATMs where a person can deposit cash. I've always found the ease of USAA's online banking and customer service worth the extra effort needed to deposit cash, though.

We have two banks that we use usaa and navy federal, both have worked out really well. We are a active duty military family and sometimes its easier to have a "online" bank. We always get wonderful customer service and have had no bad experiences with them. When we were stationed in japan they had one of the lowest international fees of any of the banks and if we had a problem with the account, being overseas and the time change they were quite helpful. We like both banks alot but i think i would have to lean more towards usaa.

After having Bank of America, Chase, etc. in my young adult life, upon entering into the U.S. Army did I hear about USAA. What an amazing company, I rarely have issues, and when I do, they are fast and effective with a solution. The people on the phone are always very nice. Their online banking via the web and smartphone gives me an ability to check my information and transfer funds on the fly.   The only drawback is the obvious one, they don't have brick and mortar locations. I don't discount them for this, because frankly, it is widely known and you are told before you create an account with them. How could I complain about something a company had before I joined up.

I absolutely love USAA. This is the fourth bank that I've had, and by far the best. I like that I usually get my deposits 1-2 days sooner, than I would with other banks. I have a checking, savings, car loan, and insurance accounts all through USAA. I like that they have an app that I can use for my phone, and the app is simple to use. I can even deposit my checks with my phone! USAA has awesome customer service also. Every time that I have called, I was never on hold, and all of their representative are so helpful. Another thing that is great, is that when I need to withdrawal money out of the ATM, I always get reimbursed for the fees. I cannot recommend USAA enough.

I switched to USAA after being told by Wells Fargo that my account was "custom management" and that I would have to pay a $15 monthly maintenance fee. I had heard about USAA on TV commercials, and after reading a bit on their site, I found out that they really were very transparent about their policies. I especially loved the idea that I could withdraw funds from any ATM without a fee. I tested this recently, at a casino ATM with a $3.50 fee. I was a little nervous about it, but sure enough, a $3.50 credit appeared on my account two weeks later without me saying a word! Their customer service is wonderful, too! All issues I had getting started and transferring funds were quickly resolved for me. The only thing I would want different about this account is the ability to deposit at home without having an auto insurance policy through them (or whatever the policy is). It's really a wonderful bank, though, and I am completely satisfied with my choice. I recommend them to everyone I know.

The USAA American Express Credit Card is a really great card to have on hand. There are several different reasons as to what makes this card so great. The first is that you can have an automated payment made so that you will never fall behind on your payments. The second is the ease of cash advances. Very easily accessed the option and very quickly processed and transferred. The third is the points reward system. You get an initial point score of 2500 as soon as you make your first purchase. Lastly this is one of the few cards I have ever seen that provide roadside assistance with the ownership of the card. This card is for active duty and retired personnel.

I have had USAA banking for seven years and four years ago I applied for this card. I love the rewards at the end of the year, it is always nice to see money deposited as opposed to "spent". I love how easy they make it to make payments and how notify you when payments are due. The customer service for this card, and bank in general, is excellent. So, if there is ever a problem they are on top of it and fix it as soon as possible. I usually only use this card for "emergencies", but I always feel safe using it.  They have all kinds of programs  that give you money back (spend $25 at 5 different locations and get rewards, during the holiday season 2011). I love USAA, and if you qualify for this card, do it.

I think the USAA World Master card is great.  I like that they offer incentives to use the card beyond points.  For example, there was a promotion where if I spent X amount over say a 6week period I got a free companion airfare.  Recently, you got $10 if you used the card a certain amount of times during a period.  You also accrue points which are good for things like gift cards. They are very easy to redeem.  As a company, USAA is wonderful to deal with and the cards are no different.  Another bonus is that if you use the card to rent a vehicle the insurance is covered.  You also get discounts with some companies for using USAA.  I would highly recommend taking advantage of this card if you can.

USAA has been a breath of fresh air for me. I have gone through two banks including Bank of America and WAMU. This has to be the best customer service I've dealt with yet. Although there aren't any branches locally they have self-addressed/stamped envelopes that you can mail in deposits that are processed in a timely manner. If I ask a question through their web mail platform I always get a response within a day. They are also very friendly on the phone. I've had mistakes made which they were more than happy to overturn. You can never find that at one of the bigger banks. I got on board before they became as big as they are now but that hasn't changed how they help customers. USAA all the way!

USAA is the best bank that I have ever been with. The customer service, alone, shot past everything other bank. They really seem to care about you as a person at USAA. The amount of fees that they have linked to their checking accounts is way below the norm. Other banks seem to have so many, what USAA offers for the price of their fees, is absolutely worth it. The representatives that work there are always friendly and willing to help. They gladly offer their other services when they know that they would be efficient in helping me in a given situation but they don't try to sell me on them every time I visit or call in. Recommending a service is a big difference than selling a service and USAA recommends. I recommend USAA to everyone looking to change their bank.

I love USAA.  I have as many of my personal accounts through them as possible.  I use their checking account and I love it.  I can deposit my checks via my cell phone and also scan them into the system with my computer.  I have access to my account online all the time via mobile or laptop.  They are always friendly and helpful when I call and respond quickly to written inquiries as well.  I highly recommend them.  The only downside to them is that there are no physical banks as far as I know.  They have agreements with other though to allow you to use some of their facilities.  Additionally, you may use any ATM without fees and they refund fees charged by other institutions up to $15 per month.

I have had USAA as my bank for six years and I LOVE it. They make it so easy, you can check you account online, on your phone, and on your iPad. If I'm at a store and need to look at my account quickly, I just sign in and I am there. You can deposit checks at home which is nice because going to a bank can be a pain. Every time I call their customer service my problem gets solved and the person/people on the other line are always very nice and professional.

I have been using USAA Federal Savings Bank since 2000.  The customer service department is outstanding.  My husband deployed and I noticed some suspicious activity on his account in a country he was not in and I called the customer service department and they were very friendly and extremely helpful.  They took immediate action to resolve this problem and they reinstated the funds that were fraudulent.  They are very prompt at releasing funds and we actually receive our work pay a day early.  Overall, USAA is an outstanding bank to use they genuinely care about their customers and go above and beyond in their customer service department.  I would recommend USAA to anyone in the military or getting ready to enlist.

The USAA World Mastercard is one of the best parts about having a USAA account. I really enjoy the fact that you earn points on all purchases and there is really no limit on what you can spend them on. You can turn them in for cash, gift cards as well as about 10000 different items in the point store. The interest rates are good as well and depending on your credit you can get even better rates.  Customer service from USAA is always top notch, so any issues you may have with your bill or the card in general are handled very quickly. I would defiantly recommend USAA to anyone who qualifies you cannot get a better deal.

This is a pretty good credit card. The fees are reasonable as long as you remember to pay on time, the bonuses are nice, and the fact that you can use your points to donate to charity is also a good part about it. The signup bonus for said points gets you a long way towards rewards as well, and that's always nice. I wish the foreign transaction fee wasn't there, since I buy a lot of stuff where it applies, but it's only 1%, so not too big of a deal. All in all, I'd highly recommend applying for this card.

I have been a member of this bank for 5 years now. I have had many problems with this bank, including unauthorized charges, that were never removed or credited back to me. Somehow, Sirius Satelite radio got my credit card info from the Hyundai dealership where I bought my car, and decided to go ahead and charge me for service that I did not ask for. Sirius radio proceeded to charge my account several times (unauthorized) for a subscription that I never signed up for. After calling the bank to discuss the problem and report it as fraud, USAA continued to allow Sirius to make unauthorized charges to my account. I had to ask to change my checking card number and ended up handling the problem myself. They also will hold any deposit over $500 for a week. So, my paycheck for work doesn't clear until I recieve the next weeks paycheck...this is unacceptable to me! I need to have access to my paychecks! Also, there were problems with depositing more than one paycheck a week (one for me and one for my husband). We only were ever allowed to deposit $500 for the week. I couldn't pay my bills on time and racked up a lot of unnecessary late fees. I have never had such a bad experience with a bank like I did with USAA. Their customer service is absolutely horrible! From my experience, it seems they are not able to handle complaints with professionalism. I have been hung up on too many times to count! Not to mention, you have to apply for credit cards (mastercard) before they will give you a standard checking account. I would not recommend USAA to handle your finances.

If you’re an American Legion member, have played for an American Legion summer ball team, or are simply a supporter of the organization, you might want to get the American Legion Credit Card.  However, there’s a very important question you must ask yourself before deciding whether or not to apply:  Are you overpaying for branding?  In other words, does the American Legion Card donate money to the American Legion, either your rewards or a portion of American Legion Credit Card sales, and if so, are these rewards better than what you could donate yourself with another card.  The first step in answering this question is to see what rewards it offers. The American Legion Rewards Card gives you 2,500 bonus points after your initial purchase as well as 1 point for every dollar you spend.  Points are redeemable for flights at a 1% clip, for gift cards at a 0.71% rate, and for cash at a 0.83% rate.  USAA, the American Legion Card’s issuer, also donates a portion of every purchase you make to the American Legion.  Without knowing exactly how much gets donated, it is impossible tell whether this is the best card for giving back to the American Legion.  It’s clear though that it does not offer competitive rewards as far as you are concerned.  What about rates?  The American Legion Rewards Card does not offer a low introductory rate on purchases, but gives you 0% on balance transfers for 12 months.  Since this is not competitive either, you need alternatives.  The Chase Sapphire Card is actually a great option for people who want to donate money to a good cause.  It offers a $500 initial bonus for spending $3,000 in the first three months.  The Capital One Cash Card is good for ongoing donations since it gives you 1.5% cash back across all purchases.  You can also personalize the front of any Cap One card with any picture you’d like, which means you can turn them into American Legion branded cards.  The best card for people who want low rates is the No Balance Transfer Fee Slate Card from Chase.

I have had a USAA Master Card for many years.  I have always been satisfied.  I enjoy the rebate, and whenever there has been a problem, it has been resolved quickly.  When my credit card was stolen, the representative was very helpful.  The fraudulent charges were reversed and a new card was sent immediately.
